Once upon a time, people who need to do engineering calculations, for
instance as part of an aircraft design, did them with a slide rule.
</P>
<H2>Faber Castell slide rule</H2>
<P>
<IMG SRC="fcrule.jpg" ALT="Faber Castell slide rule" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=60 ALIGN=RIGHT>
My father used this slide rule for engineering calculations,
probably as early as 1938.
It's made of wood, with a cardboard sleeve with the name Faber Castell
on it.
The rule is 12&nbsp;inches long, or about 300mm.
The longer a slide rule is, the more accuracy you can obtain.

<H2>British Thornton slide rule</H2>
<P>
<IMG SRC="btrule.jpg" ALT="British Thornton slide rule" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=70 ALIGN=LEFT>
This is a slide rule made in the 1970s by the British Thornton company.
This type of slide rule was very commonly used in British schools
in the 1970s, right up until electronic calculators arrived.
It's another 12&nbsp;inch (300mm) rule.

<H2>Olivetti adding machine</H2>
<P>
<IMG SRC="olivetti.jpg" ALT="Olivetti adding machine" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=159 ALIGN=RIGHT>
I found this Olivetti mechanical adding machine in a car boot sale
in Bristol.
I think it's another relic of the 1970s, because earlier models from
Olivetti (in the 1960s) would have been set up to add the old
pounds, shillings and pence.
This was the pre-decimalisation system of British money (before 1971)
where we had twenty shillings to a pound, and twelve pence to a shilling.
Farthings were also sometimes used, worth one quarter of a penny.
Although I do have two adding machines that work in "old money",
the Olivetti is decimal.

<H2>Texas Instruments TI-58C calculator</H2>
<P>
<IMG SRC="texas.jpg" ALT="Texas Instruments TI-58C" WIDTH=48 HEIGHT=87 ALIGN=LEFT>
The TI-58C was a later model in the Texas range, and included continuous
memory.
The TI-58 didn't have any long-term storage, and the TI-59 had magnetic
cards.
All the TI machines in this range would accept little ROM cartridges in
the back, containing programs.
TI called this feature "Solid State Software".
The calculator has a red LED display, a NiCad battery pack and a hard
plastic carrying case.

<H2>Hewlett Packard HP16C calculator</H2>
<P>
<IMG SRC="hp16c.jpg" ALT="Hewlett Packard HP16C" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=126 ALIGN=LEFT>
The calculator has an LCD display, and works in Reverse Polish.
It's the only HP Reverse Polish calculator that can work in
hexadecimal, octal and binary as well as in decimal.

<H2>Hewlett Packard HP22 calculator</H2>
<P>
<IMG SRC="hp22.jpg" ALT="Hewlett Packard HP22" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=126 ALIGN=LEFT>
The calculator has an LED display, and works in Reverse Polish.
