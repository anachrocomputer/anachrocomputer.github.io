<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Screen Editor Options</H1>
<!--  Fix for our 'fmt' -->
<!--  -->
Options for
<B>se</B>
can be specified in three ways:
with the &#145;<TT>o</TT>&#146; command, on the
Shell
command line that invokes
<B>se</B>,
or in the
.RC
file.
To specify an option with the &#145;<TT>o</TT>&#146; command,
just enter &#145;<TT>o</TT>&#146; followed immediately by
the option letter and its parameters.
To specify an option on the command line,
just use &#145;<TT>-</TT>&#146; followed by the option letter and its parameters.
With this second method, if there are embedded spaces in the parameter
list, the entire option should be enclosed in quotes.
To specify an option in the
.RC
file, add a line that contains an &#145;<TT>o</TT>&#146; command as described above.
<P>
For example, to specify the &#145;<TT>a</TT>&#146; (absolute line number) option
and tab stops at column 8 and every fourth thereafter with the
&#145;<TT>o</TT>&#146; command, just enter
<PRE>
oa
ot 8 +4
</PRE>
when
<B>se</B>
is waiting for a command.
To enter the same options on the invoking command line, you might use
<PRE>
se myfile -a "-t 8 +4"
</PRE>
<P>
The following table summarizes the available
<B>se</B>
options:

<TABLE BORDER COLS=3>

<TD ALIGN=CENTER>a</TD><TD ALIGN=CENTER>oa</TD><TD ALIGN=CENTER>Absolute</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
Toggles &#147;absolute line numbers&#148; mode on and off.
When this mode is in effect,
<B>se</B>
displays absolute, numeric, line labels in the line number area
of the screen.
The default behaviour is to run with this mode turned off and hence
display upper-case letters as line labels
with the letter &#145;<TT>A</TT>&#146; corresponding to the first line in the window.
Note that
<B>se</B>
accepts numbers to identify lines no matter what mode is in effect;
it only accepts letters when letters are displayed in the line number
area.

<B>se</B>
a simple keyboard macro facility plus the ability
to redefine the control keys to emulate other editors if required.

<TABLE BORDER COLS=3>
<TR>
<TD ALIGN=CENTER>c</TD><TD ALIGN=CENTER>oc</TD><TD ALIGN=CENTER>Code</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
Toggles &#147;Source-Code&#148; mode on and off.
Normally,
<B>se</B>
regards text as an arbitrary sequence of characters,
organised into lines.
When Source-Code mode is in effect,
<B>se</B>
recognises certain symbols in a file that have special meanings.
They are the open and close comment symbols, two kinds of quotes
and both round and square brackets.
The text is scanned for these symbols and special action is taken
when they are found.
<P>
The comment symbols are used to display comments in a different colour
from program text.
The actual colour (or other visual effect) used is set by the
&#145;<TT>oj</TT>&#146; option.
As a consequence of the need to scan text for comment symbols,
<B>se</B>
also needs to know the language's quote symbols.
<P>
Finally, Source-Code mode checks for correct nesting of brackets
at certain times.
Nesting is checked only on the current line, so a spurious
warning appears if an expression has been continued from one line
to the next.
Checking is performed after each line is entered in append mode,
or after a line is changed in overlay mode.
The message &#145;<TT>bracket mismatch</TT>&#146; is displayed on the status line
when the bracket-checker spots an error.
It is only a warning and does not affect the operation of the editor.
<P>
By using the
<B>se</B>
initialisation file, it is possible
to recognise the file type, usually by its name,
and set up Source-Code mode accordingly.
Refer to the &#145;<TT>f</TT>&#146; option for details on defining symbols.
Refer to the description of the initialisation file for information
on recognising files by name.
See also the &#145;<TT>s</TT>&#146; option.

selects the placement of the current line pointer following
a &#145;<TT>d</TT>&#146; (delete) command.
&lt;dir&gt; must be either &#145;<TT>&gt;</TT>&#146; or &#145;<TT>&lt;</TT>&#146;.
If &#145;<TT>&gt;</TT>&#146; is specified, the default behavior is selected:
the line following the deleted lines becomes the new current line.
If &#145;<TT>&lt;</TT>&#146; is specified, the line immediately preceding
the deleted lines becomes the new current line.
If neither is specified,
the current value of &lt;dir&gt; is displayed in the status line.

</TABLE>
sets filetype-related options.
Usually used in the &#147;conditional&#148; blocks of the
.RC
file,
this option sets up the source-code mode of
<B>se</B>
to respond correctly to the comment symbols and quoting convention
of the current language.
The two types of quote are specified first, followed by the left
and right comment symbols and the left and right pre-processor symbols.
Finally, a character set, specified using the same shorthand
notation as &#147;tlit&#148;, that helps
<B>se</B>
to recognise reserved words.
The usual conventions for representing special characters can be
used, particularly where the comment delimiter is NEWLINE.
Any character may be used, in place of &#145;<TT>/</TT>&#146;, as a delimiter.

controls the behavior of the &#145;<TT>s</TT>&#146; (substitute)
command when it is under
the control of a &#145;<TT>g</TT>&#146; (global) command.
By default, if a substitute inside a global command fails,
<B>se</B>
will not continue with the rest of the lines which might succeed.
If &#145;<TT>og</TT>&#146; is given,
then the global substitute will continue, and lines
which failed will not be affected.
Successive &#145;<TT>og</TT>&#146; commands will toggle this behavior.

</TABLE>
Toggles line insert/delete behaviour.
Certain types of computer (those that have serial terminals)
require this option to adjust the method of screen updating.
When line insert/delete is active,
<B>se</B>
uses more efficient and logical behaviour when &#145;<TT>append</TT>&#146; mode
reaches the bottom of the screen.
When it is inactive, the behaviour can appear strange to some users,
so this option defaults to &#145;<TT>on</TT>&#146;.
&#145;<TT>oh</TT>&#146; is provided for those users whose terminals are too
slow for line insert/delete to be used.

The indent value is initially set to 1, i.e. text begins at the
left margin.
&#145;<TT>a</TT>&#146; selects auto-indent which sets the
indent to the value which equals the indent of the previous line.
If &lt;indent&gt; is an integer, then the indent value will be set
to that number.
If neither &#145;<TT>a</TT>&#146; nor &lt;indent&gt; are specified, the current value
of indent is displayed.

As an alternative to using the &#145;<TT>ok</TT>&#146; command, the &#145;<TT>oki</TT>&#146;

toggles the pattern indicator on the status line.

</TABLE>
inverts the case of all letters you type (i.e., converts
upper-case to lower-case and vice versa).
This option causes
commands to be recognised only in upper-case and alphabetic line
numbers to be displayed and recognised only in lower-case.

<TD ALIGN=CENTER>_</TD><TD ALIGN=CENTER>o_</TD><TD ALIGN=CENTER>insert</TD>

</TABLE>
toggles &#147;Insert&#148; mode.
Similar to the CTRL-A key, &#145;<TT>o_</TT>&#146; is provided to allow users
to configure
<B>se</B>
to start up with insert mode turned on.
Some users find this preferable to overtype mode.
If the terminal is able to, the
shape of the cursor is changed when in insert mode.
