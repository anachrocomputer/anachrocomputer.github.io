<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Computers I Have Built</H1>
<H2>1979: Acorn System One</H2>
<P>
<IMG SRC="acorn1.jpg" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=114 ALT="Acorn System One" ALIGN=RIGHT>
A 6502-based machine, built when I was electronics lab technician
at school.
</P>
<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>
<H2>1980: Compukit UK101</H2>
<P>
Another 6502-based machine, built from a kit.
Still working nearly 25 years later.
</P>
<H2>1984: Z80 Board</H2>
<P>
A college course project, based on the Z80 and built using wire-wrap.
I never really got enthusiastic about it, largely because of the
Z80 processor.
All project work at the time was required to be based on the Z80,
but I'm a Sixer, so I never liked it.
</P>
<H2>1992: 386SX-25 PC</H2>
<P>
Oh how dull, a 386 PC clone.
I put a motherboard in a box; how can that count as building a
computer?
Anyway, it's junked now, having never run a single byte of
true 32-bit code in its life.
</P>
<H2>1994: Transputer Board</H2>
<P>
<IMG SRC="m212f.jpg" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=123 ALT="M212 board front" ALIGN=RIGHT>
<IMG SRC="m212r.jpg" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=122 ALT="M212 board rear" ALIGN=RIGHT>
I've always liked the M212, it's my favourite transputer.
So, I used an M212 to build a QIC-02 tape drive interface.
</P>
<H2>1997: Transputer Serial Interface</H2>
<P>
For Submetrix, I put together a design for a T225-based four-port
serial
<ACRONYM TITLE="TRAnsputer Module">TRAM</ACRONYM>.
We used them for a while in the sonar systems as interfaces to
the <ACRONYM TITLE="Global Positioning System">GPS</ACRONYM>
navigation receiver and the motion reference unit.
</P>
<H2>2002: PIC-based Prototype</H2>
<P>
For <A HREF="http://www.mobilebristol.com">Mobile Bristol</A>,
I worked on some prototype PIC 16F876 designs.
They were built as plug-together wearable computers as part of the
research project.
</P>
<H2>The Ones That Got Away</H2>
<P>
I've always wanted to design and build a 6809-based machine.
I now have a fair number of 6809 chips (2MHz bus versions) as
well as the support chips.  Maybe this one'll get built after all...
</P>
<P>
I bought a 68020 development kit way back in 1986 with the
intention of building a machine around that chip.
Of course, I never did, mainly due to lack of spare time now that
I have a career in the computer industry.
I still have the chip, though, and modern CAD might just
make a 68020 design feasible.
