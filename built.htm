<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Computers I Have Built</H1>
<H2>1979: Acorn System One</H2>
<P>
<IMG SRC="acorn1.jpg" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=114 ALT="Acorn System One" ALIGN=RIGHT>
A <A HREF="http://www.6502.org">6502</A>-based machine, built when I was
electronics lab technician at school.
</P>
<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>
<H2>1980: Compukit UK101</H2>
<P>
Another <A HREF="http://www.6502.org">6502</A>-based machine, built from a kit.
Still working 28 years later.
</P>

<H2>1984: Z80 Board</H2>
<P>
A college course project, based on the Z80 and built using wire-wrap.
I never really got enthusiastic about it, largely because of the
Z80 processor.
All project work at the time was required to be based on the Z80,
but I'm a Sixer, so I never liked it.
It was supposed to be initially just a Z80 with some memory and a
serial port, then you could add a matrix keyboard and a video
circuit to make a terminal.

<H2>1992: 386SX-25 PC</H2>
<P>
Oh how dull, a 386 PC clone.
I put a motherboard in a box; how can that count as building a
computer?
Anyway, it's junked now, having never run a single byte of
true 32-bit code in its life.
I still have the motherboard, in the loft, and an AT-style mini tower case
that I
<A HREF="casemod.htm">painted black</A>.
</P>
<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>
<H2>1994: Transputer Board</H2>
<P>
<IMG SRC="m212f.jpg" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=123 ALT="M212 board front" ALIGN=RIGHT>
<IMG SRC="m212r.jpg" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=122 ALT="M212 board rear" ALIGN=RIGHT>
I've always liked the M212, it's my favourite transputer.
So, I used an M212 to build a
<ACRONYM TITLE="Quarter-Inch Committee">QIC</ACRONYM>-02
tape drive interface.
The M212 was a transputer with a built-in MFM disk drive controller.
But it had a mode switch that could change the disk controller into simply
a pair of parallel ports, right on the CPU chip.
I used it in that parallel port mode with one port used as the QIC-02
data bus and the other for all the handshaking and control signals.
I wrote an occam program to drive it all, which booted over a transputer
link (from an Atari ST) and ran in the M212's internal 2k memory.
That 2k included a 512-byte tape block buffer!

<H2>1997: Transputer Serial Interface</H2>
<P>
<IMG SRC="t225.jpg" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=120 ALT="T225 Serial TRAM" ALIGN=RIGHT>
For Submetrix, I put together a design for a T225-based four-port
serial
<ACRONYM TITLE="TRAnsputer Module">TRAM</ACRONYM>.
We used them for a while in the sonar systems as interfaces to
the <ACRONYM TITLE="Global Positioning System">GPS</ACRONYM>
navigation receiver and the motion reference unit.
I chose a Philips four-channel
<ACRONYM TITLE="Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter">UART</ACRONYM>
chip connected to the T225's external bus, along with some
<ACRONYM TITLE="Static Random-Access Memory">SRAM</ACRONYM>.
The driver software booted the transputer via a link, and then sent the
serial data in and out via the same link.

<H2>2002: PIC-based Prototype</H2>
<P>
For <A HREF="http://www.mobilebristol.com">Mobile Bristol</A>,
I worked on some prototype PIC 16F876 designs.
They were built as plug-together wearable computers as part of the
research project.
The master PIC was connected to the host (an HP iPaq) via a serial port,
and slave CPUs were attached to it via an I2C bus.
Having done that, I've decided that the PIC must be an "Eight" processor,
because I didn't like it.

<H2>2005: Atmel AVR Prototypes</H2>
<P>
In my new job, I was asked to build a small embedded system around a
microcontroller chip.
After using the PIC previously, I decided to use an Atmel AVR chip
this time.
The little circuit went together pretty well, and connected up
nicely to a PC's serial port.
I have loaded it with code written in assembler as well as code
compiled from C (with the
<A HREF="http://winavr.sourceforge.net/">WinAVR</A> package, a version of GCC).
I also built an AVR-based kit from <A HREF="http://www.edtp.com">EDTP</A>
which combines an ATmega16 microcontroller with an ethernet chip.

<H2>2005: Atmel AVR Robot Controller</H2>
<P>
<IMG SRC="atmega8.jpg" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=133 ALT="ATmega8 with LED display" ALIGN=RIGHT>
Just for fun, I bought a ready-made Atmel AVR board that was designed
for use as a robot controller.
It has an ATmega8 chip, plus a clock crystal, reset button and
programming connector.
So far, it's just been plugged into a solderless breadboard, but I've
managed to get it doing some whacky things (entirely in assembler).
I've connected an
<ACRONYM TITLE="Hewlett-Packard">HP</ACRONYM>
four-digit alphanumeric display (HPDL-1414),
a <A HREF="gpad.htm">Super Nintendo joypad</A>,
a radio-control servo, a DC motor and an
<ACRONYM TITLE="Liquid Crystal Display">LCD</ACRONYM> module.
I think the next things to add will be an analog voltage-divider
for push-button control and an
<ACRONYM TITLE="Multi Media Card">MMC</ACRONYM> interface.
Well, after all that, I think the AVR chip is definitely a "Six".

<H2>2006: Atmel AVR Prototyping Board</H2>
<P>
<IMG SRC="atmega8b.jpg" WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=225 ALT="ATmega8 on perfboard" ALIGN=RIGHT>
<IMG SRC="atmega8c.jpg" WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=225 ALT="ATmega8 with LEDs" ALIGN=RIGHT>
Another fun project, again using an Atmel AVR microcontroller chip.
This board is loosely based on the
<A HREF="http://www.arduino.cc">Arduino</A>.
I've arranged the board so that I can plug in small daughterboards
with LEDs, switches, motor drivers, and so on.
The connectors also supply power (12, 5, 3.3 and -12 volts).
Future plans are for a dual
<ACRONYM TITLE="Digital to Analog Convertor">DAC</ACRONYM>
board and an LCD board.

<H2>2008: Atmel AVR Printed Circuit Board</H2>
<P>
<IMG SRC="avrpcba.jpg" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=133 ALT="ATmega8 on PCB" ALIGN=RIGHT>
<IMG SRC="avrpcbb.jpg" WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=225 ALT="ATmega8 on PCB close-up" ALIGN=RIGHT>
I read about the Toner Transfer PCB technique, and I wanted to have a go.
I have plenty of copper-clad board from way back in the 1970s, I have
ferric chloride etchant, and I have a laser printer.
All I needed was a design, and the Atmel AVR seemed like a good chip to base it on.
Then, I spotted the
<A HREF="http://www.evilmadscientist.com/article.php/card">Evil Mad Scientist Labs business card PCB</A>
and I realised that this was what I wanted to build.
But the original card was not designed for toner transfer,
and I could see some ways to improve the design,
so I made a version of my own,
and that's what you see in the photos here.
</P>

<H2>2008?: Another Atmel AVR Prototyping Board</H2>
<P>
When I got the parts for the ATmega8 boards, I also got an ATmega32,
which is a rather more powerful AVR chip.
It has four 8-bit I/O ports, and it's in a 40-pin DIL package.
The plan is to build another prototyping board with the ATmega32,
probably with another toner transfer PCB.
Watch this space...

<H2>The Ones That Got Away</H2>
<P>
I've always wanted to design and build a
<A HREF="about6809.htm">6809</A>-based machine.
I now have a fair number of 6809 chips (2MHz bus versions from Motorola and ST Microelectronics)
as well as some rare Hitachi HD6309 chips and the required RAM, EPROM and I/O chips.
Maybe this one'll get built after all...
</P>
<P>
I bought a 68020 development kit way back in 1986 with the
intention of building a machine around that chip.
Of course, I never did, mainly due to lack of spare time now that
I have a career in the computer industry.
I still have the chip, though, and modern CAD might just
make a 68020 design feasible.
