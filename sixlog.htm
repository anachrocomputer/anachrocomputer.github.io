<P>
Having been distracted by work for over a year, I'm now back at
university, which means I have a little more time and enthusiasm
to work on 6809 code.
I've added a few things, like a visual bell function that responds
to the CTRL-G character by flashing the video screen (no audio
output hardware on this machine).
There's also a VDU test function that displays the whole 256-character
set so that I can fully test the character generator EPROM
(it's fine).
Looking at the character set, I remembered that I wanted to add
a one-pixel border around the entire screen at start-up, to help
with lining up the video monitor.
The code to do that is a bit awkward, but it works.
I've also had an idea to do 48x32 pixel block graphics using the
UK101's character set.
Then again, I might change the character generator EPROM from a
2716 to a 2732 so that I can get 16x8 pixel characters, which
will make for much nicer lower-case.
</P>
<P>
On the hardware front, I've fixed the flaky brightness control
pot on the BMC green-screen monitor that I use with the 6809 machine.
This makes it a bit easier to just switch on and go, without having
to mess about getting a good picture on the monitor.
I've also fixed up the Stag PPZ EPROM programmer which I use for
all my development work.
It was built in 1984, and needed a bit of repair to the keyboard
(photos here).
Wish I knew why it won't accept hex files at 19200 baud, though.
Maybe a few carefully-chosen delays will make it work properly.
</P>
<P>
One benefit of my previous job was that I learned about
Subversion, an open source version control system.
I've now got all the assembler, simulator and 6809 code
sources under Subversion.
This means I can easily work on them on any of the machines
that I connect to the home network, and keep the master version
up-to-date.
</P>
<P>
But now I've run out of room in the 2k byte EPROM (2716) that holds
the machine-language start-up and monitor routines.
No amount of byte-saving seems to have helped, and I'm now
down to the last 64 bytes.
That's 64 bytes with all the temporary test code removed from
the machine-code monitor, which means that I've actually got
fewer functions in there.
And all the functions I want to add next are bigger than 64 bytes,
most of them by a large margin.
I think I'll have to split the code into stuff that works and I
can leave alone (the Matrix display hack, the VDU scrolling code
and keyboard polling code)
and stuff that I want to change frequently (machine-code monitor
functions and start-up self-tests).
Then, I can put the two sections into two separate 2716 EPROMs
and put one in the ZIF socket and the other in one of the
non-ZIF sockets on the main board.
But that'll mean messing about with the addresses of stuff so
that it'll work in the other socket, which may get a bit messy.

As a first step towards implementing the frame flyback interrupt,
I've installed a Hitachi HD63B09P chip in the socket on the
Six&nbsp;Adaptor.
This is a rare chip, originally built as an enhanced 6809 but
sold as simply a clone of the 6809.
Hitachi never fully documented the enhanced features of the chip,
but most of the improvements have been deduced and written up
by enthusiasts.
The big feature that I need for the frame flyback interrupt is
the 6309's block transfer instruction, known as TFM for <B>T</B>rans<B>F</B>er <B>M</B>ultiple.
Without TFM, the original 6809 just isn't fast enough to copy the
entire 768-byte screen buffer to video RAM during the frame blanking period.
</P>
<H2>20th February 2006</H2>
<P>
Been reading Andy Hertzfield's "Revolution In the Valley -- How The Mac Was Made", which
mentions the early 6809-based Mac prototype.
It also talks about the regular frame flyback interrupt that the machine used to
synchronise with the display refresh cycle.
Now, I've never done any programming with a system like that, and I began wondering
if there'd be any benefit to using a frame flyback interrupt on the 6809 machine.
One of the flaws of the original 6502-based UK101 was that it produced video "snow"
whenever the CPU accessed the video RAM.
I started thinking about a scheme where the 6809 would copy the entire text screen
from RAM into video memory on every frame flyback (during the 3.6ms blanking period).
This would make all display updates synchronous with the display refresh, as well
as eliminating "snow" by having all video RAM accesses happen during frame blanking.
I'd need a source of interrupts, of course, as well as the software to handle them.
Might be worth trying though, just to see how it looks.

Doing a bit more with the Frankenstein Assembler, to give it
its full name.
It was posted to the comp.sources newsgroup in 1990, in many
separate 'shar' archives.
I now have all those archives from an FTP site and I'm
putting them together again.
My plan is to put together a proper release of a new version,
with bug fixes, removal of compiler/linker warnings and
portability to NetBSD on both 32 and 64-bit hosts.
I have an Alpha and an UltraSparc to test it on.
Will probably do the same things with the 6809
simulator, too.

Ignore everything I said about 'printf' yesterday.
The assembler doesn't even use 'printf' to generate hex
digits in the object code and only uses it occasionally
in the listing file.
I'd already fixed the assembler by changing an array
of ASCII codes in the source, but I have absolutely
no recollection of doing that.
I hadn't installed the fixed version on my development
machine (but I have now).
And I've fixed the 'Makefile' so that the options come
before the filename arguments, as they should do.
</P>

Messing about with the 6809 assembler today.
Decided to try compiling it on the 64-bit Alpha machine
that I happen to have, running the NetBSD operating system.
I get a few niggling differences from the Linux-compiled
version of the assembler.
First of all, I get a warning about the use of 'mktemp'
to create a temporary file.
Next, the command-line parsing doesn't work the same
as it did on Linux (all the options must come before the
filenames).
And finally, the output files are different!
Exactly the same size, but the NetBSD versions have the
hex numbers in upper case (as they should be) instead
of in lower case (which caused the problem I described
in the original notes about the EPROM programmer).
</P>
<P>
So, I recompiled the assembler on Linux, just to make sure.
And I get the same warning about 'mktemp'!
Looks like I really do need to fix that.
And now the Linux version has upper-case hex, too!
Well, the Linux 'printf' was obviously the source
of the trouble, and in between Slackware 8.0 and Slackware
10.1, they've fixed it.
And I hadn't recompiled since I did the upgrade.
</P>
<H2>17th December 2005</H2>
<P>
Ran the Matrix display hack again.
Really must do more with the machine than this!
</P>
<H2>4th December 2005</H2>
<P>
Over a year since the last log entry here and no real
progress with the 6809 software.
I run the machine occasionally to impress visitors
with the Matrix display hack, though.
I now have a few of the rare-as-hen's-teeth
Hitachi 6309 chips, as well as a board to run them in.
In principle, they'd work in the Six Adaptor, but
I've not actually tried it yet.
</P>

Starting a new job today, with Linux on the ARM.
May not have much time to work on 6809 code.
</P>
<H2>31st October</H2>
<P>
Playing tetris on the Game Boy is making me think about writing
games for this machine.
There's no way to connect a game controller, though, so I'd only
have keyboard controls.
And there's no sound and no colour apart from green.
</P>
<H2>30th October</H2>
<P>
Visitors most impressed with retro text-mode Matrix.
</P>
<H2>29th October</H2>
<P>
Plugged in a real green-screen monitor for the full effect.
My usual UK101 monitor is a nice Philips amber one,
but I have a couple of BMC monitors in the loft with green
phosphor.
The contrast control is a bit noisy, but it works.
</P>
<H2>28th October</H2>
<P>
More work on the Matrix display.
Made the startup look right, with a random number (0-15) of blanks
preceeding the random symbols.
This allows the faster-scrolling columns to reach the bottom of the
screen before the slower ones have got started.
But as yet, no fresh blanks are introduced to make gaps in the
display.
Nor do columns occasionally stop and restart.
</P>
<H2>27th October</H2>
<P>
The Matrix
was shown on TV the other day, and inspired me to write a green-screen
display hack.
So, first of all I'll need a video memory save/restore routine -- not
too hard in 6809 assembler with proper 16-bit index registers.
Next, a random number generator (24 bit shift register with exclusive-OR
feedback, as shown in Horowitz & Hill).
Finally, some tricky timing code to allow each column of the video
screen to trickle down at different speeds.
Use the random number generator to produce new characters at the top,
but limit the choice to 64 non-alphabetic characters.
The UK101's tile graphics turn out to be quite good for this sort
of display!
</P>
<H2>26th October</H2>
<P>
No progress.
</P>
<H2>25th October</H2>
<P>
Coded a new version of the UK101's '@' command to read a memory
address and then display the contents of that address.
Then, allow the user to edit the contents in hex and/or move
on to the next (or previous) address.
</P>
<H2>24th October</H2>
<P>
Decided to implement a very simple machine-code monitor just so that
I can get some software running on the 6809 without getting bogged down
in the details of the design.
</P>
<H2>23rd October</H2>
<P>
Linux User Group meeting.
Back at the 6809, thinking about ways to improve the UK101 machine-code
monitor to allow for such luxuries as a backspace key.
There are quite a few ways of doing that, all with their good
and bad points.
</P>
<P>
Deciphering the 6502 disassembler code seems to have done my head in.
</P>
<H2>22nd October</H2>
<P>
No progress on the 6809 code today, because I've been distracted by
looking at the original 6502 code on the
<A HREF="uk101.htm">UK101</A>.
I'll probably implement a 6809 machine-code monitor next, which will
most likely be very similar to the 6502 monitor in the UK101.
So, I'd better remind myself how that works.
It's been 20 years since I last had a look at that code, and there
are plenty of parts that I never understood in the first place.
In particular, the 6502 disassembler was always a complete mystery
to me.
There are no ASCII codes in the EPROM for any of the 6502 mnemonics,
nor are there visible ASCII codes for addressing mode syntax like
',X)' or '),Y'.
</P>
<H2>21st October</H2>
<P>
Decided to implement the cursor today, as well as fix the bug I introduced
yesterday.
The cursor on the original UK101 wasn't very exciting, just a blob (half
as tall as a character cell).
My improved UK101 monitor EPROM had two cursor styles, one for input
from the keyboard and another for input from the cassette (both a full
character cell in height).
Might as well do the same thing for the 6809 version.
No need for the cassette input yet, although I'll leave a place in the
code to add it in later.
</P>
<P>
Having fixed the shift-key code, and made the keyboard polling routine
into a proper subroutine with register save and restore, I quite rapidly
fill the screen with text and have to reset.
I can't keep going because there's no scrolling routine yet.
But how hard can it be?
This is a 6809, after all, with 16-bit index registers and a 16-bit
accumulator.
Ended up with VDU scrolling working after one duff version.
</P>
<H2>20th October</H2>
<P>
Went to the lecture at HP Labs about the Airbus A380.
Got the keyboard and auto-repeat working.
Messed up the shift-key code.
</P>
<H2>19th October</H2>
<P>
No progress today, due to an unprecedented amount of social life for
a Tuesday evening.
</P>
<H2>18th October</H2>
<P>
First thing to do this evening is to write a reasonably accurate delay
routine.
I'll need delays for the keyboard polling, debouncing and auto-repeat code.

Single keyboard poll, then timing loop with 100us delay on scope.
</P>
<H2>17th October</H2>
<P>
Initial RAM test.
Keyboard self-test shows that at least I can read and write the
keyboard port.
Finally understood UK101's original keyboard poller.
It's just three different delays, and a simple decision on which
delay to use.
</P>
<H2>16th October</H2>
<P>
ROM checksum.
Messing about with 6850
ACIA,
but got initialisation code wrong.
Finally able to send ASCII to ACIA at 300 baud, but still can't
use the keyboard.
</P>
<H2>15th October</H2>
<P>
No progress.
</P>
<H2>14th October</H2>
<P>
Rudimentary code to send
ASCII
codes to the
VDU
as if it were a terminal.
Simple cursor position and cursor motion code but no scrolling yet.
No visible cursor, either.
Simple Bash script to send
<ABBREV TITLE="hexadecimal">hex</ABBREV>
files to the
<A HREF="inst.htm#PPZ">Stag PPZ</A>
EPROM programmer.
</P>
<H2>13th October 2004</H2>
<P>
Initial version with very basic clear-screen followed by placing "Hello,
World" message in VDU RAM, then hang.
This works first time (once I get a working CPU clock) and proves
that I've got the hardware wired up OK.
It also proves that the
<ACRONYM TITLE="Erasible Programmable Read-Only Memory">EPROM</ACRONYM>
programming is OK, and the 6809 assembler
on the Linux machine is generating good code.
