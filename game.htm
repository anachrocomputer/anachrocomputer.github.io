<H2>Vectrex video game system</H2>
<P>
Introduced by General Consumer Electronics (GCE) in 1983.
British version was imported by Milton-Bradley (MB), the well-known
toy maker.

There are many Vectrex resources on the Net, including
a DOS Vectrex Emulator, and of course the 'rec.games.vectrex'
newsgroup.
The machine is based on the powerful <A HREF="http://www.motorola.com">Motorola</A>
8-bit CPU, the

The basic Vectrex was supplied with a single built-in game,
called Mine Storm.
This is actually a thinly-disguised version of Asteroids.
However, since you're shooting at mines instead of rocks,
they are allowed to shoot back, or follow you around, or even
become invisible.
</P>
<P>
I have nearly all the game cartridges ever produced for the Vectrex.
I was lucky enough to find someone who had bought one of each
game cartridge when they were still being sold by
Woolworth's.
</P>
<P>
A rare add-on item for the Vectrex system, the light pen
allowed the user to interact with the screen display.
It was supplied with a simple drawing program called Art Master
and a more advanced animation program, AnimAction, was also
available.
I have both of these, bought directly from MB in about 1984.
</P>
<P>
The 3D Imager was a really rare add-on,
which gave the system a stereoscopic
three-dimensional display.
It worked by spinning a shutter/filter disc in front of the
user's eyes (it was in the form of a headband and goggles)
and synchronisation signals were fed to the program running
on the Vectrex to allow separate images to be fed to the left
and right eye.
Unfortunately, I don't have one of these.

<H2>Atari 2600 video game system</H2>
<P>One of the 'classic' home video game systems of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The basic 2600 was a
<A HREF="http://www3.sk.sympatico.ca/jbayko/cpu.html#6502">6502</A>
processor in a small console.
Unlike the Vectrex, there was no built-in game.
</P>
<P>
I have only a few 2600 game cartridges, including Jr. Pac-Man and
Centipede.
