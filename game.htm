<H2>Vectrex Video Game System</H2>
<P>
The
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vectrex" TITLE="Wikipedia: Vectrex">Vectrex</A>
was introduced by General Consumer Electronics (GCE) in 1983.
The British version was imported by Milton-Bradley (MB), the well-known
toy maker.

<A HREF="vectrex2.jpg"><IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="vectrex1.jpg" ALT="Photo of Vectrex" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=268></A>
There are many Vectrex resources on the Net, including
a DOS Vectrex Emulator, and of course the 'rec.games.vectrex'
newsgroup.
The machine is based on the powerful
<A HREF="http://www.motorola.com">Motorola</A>
8-bit CPU, the
<A HREF="http://www3.sk.sympatico.ca/jbayko/cpu.html#6809">6809</A>.
</P>
<P>
The basic Vectrex was supplied with a single built-in game,
called Mine Storm.
This is actually a thinly-disguised version of Asteroids.
However, since you're shooting at mines instead of rocks,
they are allowed to shoot back, or follow you around, or even
become invisible.
</P>
<P>
I have nearly all the game cartridges ever produced for the Vectrex.
I was lucky enough to find someone who had bought one of each
game cartridge when they were still being sold by
Woolworth's.
</P>

<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="veclpen.jpg" ALT="Vectrex Light Pen" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=142>
A rare add-on item for the Vectrex system, the light pen
allowed the user to interact directly with the screen display.
It was supplied with a simple drawing program called Art Master
and a more advanced animation program, AnimAction, was also
available.
I have both of these, bought directly from MB in about 1984.
</P>
<P>
The 3D Imager was a really rare add-on,
which gave the system a stereoscopic
three-dimensional display.
It worked by spinning a shutter/filter disc in front of the
user's eyes (it was in the form of a headband and goggles)
and synchronisation signals were fed to the program running
on the Vectrex to allow separate images to be fed to the left
and right eye.
Unfortunately, I don't have one of these.

<H2>Nintendo Entertainment System</H2>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="zapper.jpg" ALT="NES Zapper" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=125>
<P>
The Nintendo Zapper was an add-on for the Nintendo Entertainment
System of the early 1980s.
Only two games were released for it (in PAL), Duck Hunt and Wild Gunman.
For greater accuracy, you could get an add-on sight which was made
by Quick Shot, the joystick company.
</P>

<H2>Super Nintendo Entertainment System</H2>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="snes.jpg" ALT="SNES" WIDTH=250 HEIGHT=151>
<P>
The Super Nintendo is another of the classic video game systems.
My example is shown here with the Super Mario Paint cartridge and
its associated two-button mouse.
The game is a fairly good graphical paint package, along with a
fly-swatting game and a music sequencer.
The SNES is based on the 65816, a 16-bit extension of the
6502 architecture.

<H2>Atari 2600 Video Game System</H2>
<P>One of the 'classic' home video game systems of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The basic 2600 was a
<A HREF="http://www3.sk.sympatico.ca/jbayko/cpu.html#6502">6502</A>
processor in a small console.
Unlike the Vectrex, there was no built-in game.
</P>
<P>
I have only a few 2600 game cartridges, including Jr. Pac-Man and
Centipede.
</P>
<H2>The Nintendo Game Boy</H2>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="jpgb.jpg" WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=236 ALT="Game Boy">
<P>
The Z80-based Game Boy was first produced in 1989 and was the machine
that popularised the game of Tetris.
It has the same controls as the NES, namely a four-way joypad, two
fire buttons and two game-control buttons.
It's powered by four AA-size cells (the Game Boy Pocket only needed
two AAA-size cells).
My example is one of the brightly-coloured versions that were produced.

games.

It can't be an Old Sad Thing yet!
