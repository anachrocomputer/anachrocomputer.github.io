The UK101 is an 8-bit microcomputer based on the MOS Technologies
6502.
This is the same CPU as the Apple II, the Commodore PET and
the BBC Micro.
In common with most machines of its day, the UK101 had a BASIC
interpreter in ROM.
In fact, at the time, it was difficult to imagine a machine
that <EM>didn't</EM> run BASIC.

Before the UK101 came the Ohio Scientific Superboard.
The two machines were very similar, so much so that were was
talk of legal action at Ohio Scientific.
They weren't identical, though, because the UK101 worked at
at UK video frequencies and had the 5-volt power regulator built-in.

In common with many microcomputers of the early 1980s, the UK101
had a memory-mapped text display, BASIC in ROM, a cassette
interface and a switch-matrix keyboard.
It didn't use the 6502's interrupts at all; I/O was done by
polling.
There was a crude expansion connector for additional memory
and peripherals.
The memory map was conventional for the 6502, with RAM at
the lower addresses, I/O in the middle and ROM at the higher
addresses.

Interfaces on the UK101 were quite limited, as on most microcomputers
of the time.
The video output was a 625-line, 50Hz signal modulated onto the UK
channel 36.
A minor modification would allow the use of a composite-video monitor.
Data storage was via the 300 baud cassette tape interface.
BASIC programs were recorded in ASCII source form, while machine code
programs used a hex format.
In practice, most machine-code programs initially loaded a checksum
loader, and that then ran to read data in

The Extended Monitor program would allow the user to write checksum
format tapes, too.

The UK101 had a 40-pin DIL socket known as the "J1 Expansion Connector".
It was intended to be used to connect up a disk controller or other
peripherals.
In fact, the original Practical Electronics article claimed that it
"Supports all Ohio Scientific expansions including floppy disc"
and included a photograph of the disc unit plugged in.

Comp Shop planned a few add-on devices for the UK101, but the only
one I ever saw was the colour video board.
It consisted of a couple of 2114 memories, some multiplexers and
an RGB output stage.
I actually borrowed the prototype for a weekend to try it out!
I don't think it was ever made into a product, but I built a
similar circuit into my machine.

Other hobbyist suppliers at the time did produce expansion
boards for the UK101.
In fact, for a brief period there was competition for the best
UK101 Monitor ROM.
Chromasonics produced a colour video board, a sound board,
a parallel printer interface and a memory expansion board.
Several suppliers made cases and memory expansion boards.

Practical Electronics published some hardware projects based on
the UK101, notably an EPROM programmer by Dr. A.A.Berk.
A seven-part series appeared from January to July 1981 called
"Interfacing Compukit".
