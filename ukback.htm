Can you answer any of these questions about the UK101?
<UL>
<LI>Who was Dr A.A.Berk and where is he now? His name appears in a
Practical Electronics review (April 1980) of the Edukit.
He is credited with the design of the Edukit, which was a very
low-cost microprocessor board based on the RCA COSMAC 1802.
The machine was built by Modus Systems Ltd., of Letchworth.
His name also appears on a book about the Lisp programming language
and a review of the Softy EPROM programmer (PE January 1980).
<LI>Who was the mysterious Andy Fisher, mentioned in the manual in
connection with the UK101's software?
He is thanked in the introduction, and credited with the cassette
save routine.
<LI>Who was David Fine, also mentioned in the manual with a Milton Keynes
phone number that you could call for &ldquo;advice of a technical nature&rdquo;?
<LI>Did anyone actually connect up the Ohio Scientific floppy disk
interface and make it work?
<LI>Did anybody write a Monopoly game, just to use those little
&ldquo;house&rdquo; and &ldquo;hotel&rdquo; characters in the graphics set?
<LI>How many Compukits were sold, in all?
</UL>

<P>
Without actually looking at the code, I asked:
<UL>
<LI>Who wrote the two sample games &ldquo;Hectic&rdquo; and &ldquo;New York Taxi&rdquo;?
</UL>
</P>
<P>
Well, Stephen Crane had a look at his copy of these two fine games
and told me that NYT was written by K. Stephens and Hectic by Bryan D.
Ungard.
I wonder where they are now?
