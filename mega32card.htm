<P>
In <A HREF="mega8card.htm">another page</A>, I described a
<ACRONYM TITLE="Printed Circuit Board">PCB</ACRONYM> that I made
to hold an Atmel AVR microcontroller chip, the ATmega8.
Having done that, and having learnt about the ATmega8, some of the limitations
of that chip became apparant.
But the ATmega8 is not the only AVR chip!
There are many others, and the one that looked like a good choice for a second
PCB was the ATmega32.
This chip comes in a 40-pin DIL package (as well as in surface-mount packages)
and has four 8-bit parallel I/O ports.
</P>
<P>
Another advantage of using the larger AVR chip is that there are still more
devices to choose from that fit the same basic chip pinout.
Going up the scale from the ATmega32, there's the ATmega644, which has more
memory as well as extra I/O devices.
The pinout is much the same, for all these 40-pin DIL chips, so one PCB should
work for all of them.
Another advantage of the new chips is that they have two serial ports, which makes
applications like serial protocol convertors possible.
</P>
<P>
This list summarises the design goals for this board, in no particular order:
<UL>
<LI>Make the PCB with Toner Transfer</LI>
<LI>Stick to a single sided board</LI>
<LI>Use an Atmel AVR chip, the ATmega32</LI>
<LI>In future, use a larger AVR chip, the ATmega644</LI>
<LI>Use up another spare piece of copper-clad board I've had since the 1970s</LI>
<LI>Maximise the usefulness of the PCB for breadboarding/prototyping</LI>
<LI>Like the Arduino, fit sockets for I/O connections</LI>
<LI>Place all I/O connectors on a 0.1&nbsp;inch grid for compatibility with stripboard</LI>
<LI>Include power and ground pins on the I/O sockets</LI>
<LI>Allow for four 16-pin I/O sockets, one for each eight-bit port on the AVR</LI>
<LI>All I/O sockets to share a common pinout</LI>
<LI>Fit a dual RS-232 level shifter chip (MAX232 or MAX220)</LI>
<LI>Fit a six-pin programming header, with polarisation keyway</LI>
<LI>Fit a reset button</LI>
<LI>Make PCB tracks wide enough for easy toner transfer</LI>
<LI>Install a power-on LED</LI>
<LI>Minimise area of copper etched away, to make ferric chloride last longer</LI>
<LI>Stick to business card or ISO credit card size</LI>
<LI>Use a ground track all around outside edges</LI>
<LI>Use free and open source tools, e.g. GNU PCB</LI>
</UL>
In order to achieve the proper pinout on the I/O connectors, I had to reverse the
sequence of the connections to the Port&nbsp;A pins, pins 33 to 40 on the DIL chip.
This made all of the I/O connectors identical, with one connector for each of the
ATmega32's four I/O ports: Ports A, B, C and D.
This is what leads to the track pattern that you can see in the lower left-hand
corner of the photo of the PCB, below.
Four pins on each connector were set aside for ground, and four pins for 5V power.
I would have liked to have added additional power supply voltages, but the constraint
of using a single-sided PCB made that too difficult.
</P>
<P>
One thing I didn't do was add the dual RS-232 buffer chip.
The reason was rather silly: my offcut of copper-clad PCB material was too small to
build the complete board!
I left off about a fifth of the design, which meant that I had to omit the MAX232
or MAX220 chip.
Of course, the Atmel AVR chip still has the serial ports in it, so I can add an
off-board level shifter if and when required.
I could even build a level shifter chip into a 9-pin "D" connector.
</P>
<P>
The final design was done using the free GNU PCB program and then printed onto
junk-mail paper with an HP LaserJet 4+ printer.
The toner from that printing was then transferred to the copper-clad board with
a hot domestic smoothiing iron and the paper was soaked in warm water to remove it,
leaviing the board ready to etch.
Etching was done with ferric chloride in the usual way, and then the
toner was removed with acetone, leaving the board ready to drill.
I drilled most of the holes to 0.8mm diameter, but some of them needed
to be a little larger, 1.0mm.
The larger size was needed for the I/O connectors, the two-pin power connector,
the reset switch and the six-pin programming header.

Having completed the board, of course I have found a number of mistakes in the design.
The main problems are with clearances; I just didn't leave enough room around the
16-pin I/O connectors.
The placement of one of the wire links ended up underneath the six-pin programming header,
which requires a little care in assembly to fit that wire first.
The four I/O connectors look good, but if I was to build a board that used all of them
and plugged in on top of the AVR board, all sorts of things would get in the way.
It would be much better to keep the area clear for plug-ins and move the power connector,
programming header and power-on LED out to the ends of the board.
</P>
<P>
The 15mil (15 thousandths of an inch) tracks have worked perfectly, connecting the
six-pin programming header to the proper pins on the AVR chip.
I didn't need to use the wire links to make those connections.
The pull-up resistor for RESET fits OK under the AVR chip's socket, even if
it is a bit of a kludge.
