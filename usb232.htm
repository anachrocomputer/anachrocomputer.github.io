It's often useful to connect a microcontroller's serial port to a host
computer for debugging.
Years ago, one might even use an actual serial terminal for this sort of work,
but nowadays a terminal emulator program on a PC is much more commonly used.
With an older PC or laptop, one could simply connect the microcontroller
to the serial port via a suitable level shifter.
Modern PCs, and especially laptops, do not have a serial port, however.
The usual solution is to use a
<acronym title="Universal Serial Bus">USB</acronym> port on the PC to
connect to a USB-to-serial adaptor.
The microcontroller still requires a level shifter to connect to the RS-232
port on the adaptor, because the adaptor itself also contains a level shifter.
So we have this chain of connections: PC -- USB chip -- level shifter -- RS-232 -- level shifter -- microcontroller.
Surely we can cut out the pair of level shifters and connect directly from
the USB chip to the microcontroller?
</p>
<p>
This is exactly what some microcontroller boards do, notably the Arduino.
They contain a built-in USB chip that appears, to the host side, as a serial
port.
The chip then connects directly, at
<acronym TITLE="Transistor-Transistor Logic">TTL</acronym> levels, to the microcontroller's
<acronym TITLE="Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter">UART</acronym>.
But what about microcontroller boards that do not contain a USB interface chip?
Can we make something similar ourselves?
</p>
<p>
We can indeed make a USB serial to TTL-level microcontroller interface cable,
by taking advantage of the commonly-available mobile phone interface cables.
These cables connect a host computer's USB port to the phone via a serial
connection, just as we want to do with a microcontroller (after all, the phone
contains a microcontroller of some sort).
We must cut off the plug on the phone end of the cable and replace it with
a small circuit of our own.
</p>
<p>
The two most useful mobile phone cables for this purpose are the
CA-42 and the DKU-5.
