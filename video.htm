<H2>Philips N1700</H2>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="n1700_1.jpg" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=115 ALT="Photo of N1700">
The long-play version of the original Philips N1500.
Also had the luxury of a digital clock for timed operation
(the N1500 had an analog clock).
The Philips VCR format used a cassette quite unlike modern types.
The two spools of tape were arranged not side-by-side but
one above the other.
The tape took a diagonal path from lower spool to upper,
resulting in the player's
head drum being vertical.
Modern VHS machines have an angled head drum.

<H2>Sony C20 Betamax</H2>
<P>
Of course, no video collection is complete without a Betamax.
Mine's a non-working Sony C20, but I'm looking for a C7, or one of
the Sanyo models that could record in audio-only mode.
Perhaps the ultimate Betamax machine is the Betastack,
a sort of autochanger for video tapes that fitted on top
of one of the more sophisticated players.
</P>
<H2>Philips Video 2000</H2>
<P>
The new, innovative and doomed video format from Philips.
Tapes could record four hours on each side, i.e. eight hours
in all.
I have a few of the older VR2020 generation, in various states
of non-function.
One of them has the optional extra remote control, which comprised
an infra-red receiver, a decoder box and the control itself.
I usually use the newer VR2324 model (actually badged by Pye as a
23VR24), which is new enough
to have a SCART socket on the back.
Lots of info on Video 2000 (and Betamax and U-matic, too) at

<H2>Technicolor 212E</H2>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="cvc1.jpg" ALT="Photo of Technicolor 212E" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=133>
Introduced in the early 1980s,
this forgotten video cassette system is based on a tiny
quarter-inch tape format.
It was designed for use as a portable video system with
a camera, rather like a modern camcorder.
In fact, it was intended as a replacement for 8mm home movies.
</P>
<P>
It came with a video camera, a JVC model GX-44E.
It has a vidicon tube, unlike a modern CCD camera.
The vidicon can't produce a picture in poor light, which rather limits
its usefulness as a home movie system.
</P>
<P>
I have the recorder, camera and power supply but no tuner.
Unfortunately, I have only one tape.
The tape has the initials CVC on it, standing for Compact
Video Cassette.

<H2>CED Video Disk</H2>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="ced1.jpg" ALT="Photo of Hitachi CED player" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=134>
CED stands for Capacitance Electronic Disk, an RCA invention.
The disk is housed in a rigid plastic sleeve that the player unlocks
and removes.
Quite a few of the disks are music videos, perhaps due
to the availability of stereo sound in this format.
I have a copy of <CITE>Das Boot</CITE> on CED format video disk.
<A HREF="http://www.cedmagic.com/">CED Magic</A>.
<BR CLEAR=LEFT>
</P>
<H2>Laser Disk</H2>
<P>
Huge, thick and heavy disks, silvered like a CD but analog not digital.
Each side of a disk could hold about an hour of video, so feature
films require a pause in the middle to flip the disk over.
Some films are on two disks.
Again, a stereo sound track is available, and sometimes even
a dual mono arrangement with different audio content on the two
channels.
</P>
<H2>Sony Half-inch Video Tape</H2>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="sonyvid1.jpg" ALT="Photo of Sony CV-2100ACE" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=136>
Sony introduced a half-inch, reel-to-reel,
helical scan video system in about 1964.
The system was monochrome and available in both
525-line and 625-line versions.
</P>
<P>
The model CV-2100ACE
recorder is big and heavy with all the circuitry
made using discrete transistors.
There's no timer, tuner or RF modulator.
</P>
<P>
Machines like this were distributed to many schools in the UK
during the 1970s, along with large video monitors in big wooden
cabinets.
This was an early attempt to use video as a teaching aid,
but it didn't seem to catch on until VHS arrived.
<BR CLEAR=LEFT>
</P>
<H2>U-matic</H2>
<P>
Sony introduced U-matic in 1971 with a three-quarter
inch tape cassette that could record for one hour.
This system became very popular with industrial and
broadcasting users, and is still used today.
It could record in colour, and both NTSC and PAL
versions were made.
The sound track is dual and could be used either as stereo
or as two completely separate tracks.
</P>
<P>
The U-matic machine is a JVC top-loader.
Like the reel-to reel, there's no timer, tuner or RF modulator.
