<H2>Philips N1700</H2>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="n1700_1.jpg" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=115 ALT="Photo of N1700">
The long-play version of the original Philips N1500.
Also had the luxury of a digital clock for timed operation
(the N1500 had an analog clock).
The Philips VCR format used a cassette quite unlike modern types.
The two spools of tape were arranged not side-by-side but
one above the other.
The tape took a diagonal path from lower spool to upper,
resulting in the player's
head drum being vertical.
Modern VHS machines have an angled head drum.

<H2>Sony C20 Betamax</H2>
<P>
Of course, no video collection is complete without a Betamax.
Mine's a non-working Sony C20, but I'm looking for a C7, or one of
the Sanyo models that could record in audio-only mode.
Perhaps the ultimate Betamax machine is the Betastack,
a sort of autochanger for video tapes that fitted on top
of one of the more sophisticated players.
</P>
<H2>Philips Video 2000</H2>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="23vr24.jpg" ALT="Pye 23VR24" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=63>
<P>
The new, innovative and doomed video format from Philips.
Tapes could record four hours on each side, i.e. eight hours
in all.
I have a few of the older VR2020 generation, in various states
of non-function.
One of them has the optional extra remote control, which comprised
an infra-red receiver, a decoder box and the control itself.
I usually use the newer VR2324 model (actually badged by Pye as a
23VR24), which is new enough
to have a SCART socket on the back.
Lots of info on Video 2000 (and Betamax and U-matic, too) at

<H2>Technicolor 212E</H2>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="cvc1.jpg" ALT="Photo of Technicolor 212E" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=133>
Introduced in the early 1980s,
this forgotten video cassette system is based on a tiny
quarter-inch tape format.
It was designed for use as a portable video system with
a camera, rather like a modern camcorder.
In fact, it was intended as a replacement for 8mm home movies.
</P>
<P>
It came with a video camera, a JVC model GX-44E.
It has a vidicon tube, unlike a modern CCD camera.
The vidicon can't produce a picture in poor light, which rather limits
its usefulness as a home movie system.
</P>
<P>
I have the recorder, camera and power supply but no tuner.
Unfortunately, I have only one tape.
The tape has the initials CVC on it, standing for Compact
Video Cassette.
<BR CLEAR=LEFT>

<H2>Amstrad VMC100 VHS-C camcorder</H2>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="vmc100.jpg" ALT="Amstrad VMC100 VHS-C camcorder" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=124>
VHS-C, or Compact VHS, was introduced solely for use in camcorders.
It uses the same tape and tape format as VHS, but in a much smaller cassette,
which only contains enough tape for 30 minutes recording (60 minutes in long-play mode).
The VHS-C cassette is then inserted into a special holder, the same size and shape as
a full-size VHS cassette, and played back in a normal VHS player.
</P>
<P>
The Amstrad VMC100, introduced in 1988, is a very basic (and very cheap) camcorder.
It has no zoom lens, no focusing, no playback capability and a simple optical
viewfinder.
It can't even rewind the VHS-C cassette (you have to use the adaptor and the full-size
VHS machine for that).
It does have a switch for SP/LP mode, and a white-balance switch.
Most of the bulk of the camcorder is taken up by the cassette mechanism,
with just the front section containing all the electronics (maybe 20% of the total
length).

<H2>CED Video Disk</H2>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="ced1.jpg" ALT="Photo of Hitachi CED player" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=134>
CED stands for Capacitance Electronic Disk, an RCA invention.
The disk is housed in a rigid plastic sleeve that the player unlocks
and removes.
Quite a few of the disks are music videos, perhaps due
to the availability of stereo sound in this format.
I have a copy of <CITE>Das Boot</CITE> on CED format video disk.

</P>
<H2>Laser Disk</H2>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="cld310.jpg" ALT="Pioneer CLD-S310S" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=50>
<P>
Huge, thick and heavy disks, silvered like a CD but holding an analog
video signal.
Each side of a disk could hold about an hour of video, so feature
films require a pause in the middle to flip the disk over.
Some films are on two disks.
Again, a stereo sound track is available, and sometimes even
a dual mono arrangement with different audio content on the two
channels.
I have several examples of video disk players, starting with
the original Philips VLP600.
My newest model is a Pioneer CLD-S310S, which is the only model I
have that's capable of playing the newer, digital soundtrack disks.

<H2>Sony Half-inch Video Tape</H2>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="sonyvid1.jpg" ALT="Photo of Sony CV-2100ACE" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=136>
Sony introduced a half-inch, reel-to-reel,
helical scan video system in about 1964.
The system was monochrome and available in both
525-line and 625-line versions.
</P>
<P>
The model CV-2100ACE
recorder is big and heavy with all the circuitry
made using discrete transistors.
There's no timer, tuner or RF modulator.
</P>
<P>
Machines like this were distributed to many schools in the UK
during the 1970s, along with large video monitors in big wooden
cabinets.
This was an early attempt to use video as a teaching aid,
but it didn't seem to catch on until VHS arrived.
<BR CLEAR=LEFT>
</P>
<H2>U-matic</H2>
<P>
Sony introduced U-matic in 1971 with a three-quarter
inch tape cassette that could record for one hour.
This system became very popular with industrial and
broadcasting users, and is still used today.
It could record in colour, and both NTSC and PAL
versions were made.
The sound track is dual and could be used either as stereo
or as two completely separate tracks.
</P>
<P>
The U-matic machine is a JVC top-loader.
Like the reel-to reel, there's no timer, tuner or RF modulator.

<A NAME="Microvision">
<H2>Sinclair Microvision pocket TV</H2>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="sinctv1.jpg" ALT="Photo of Sinclair Microvision" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=137>
<P>
The original Sinclair pocket TV was a multi-standard set, designed
to work on most of the TV systems in the world.
It was marketed as the ideal thing for world travellers to take with
them and watch wherever they went.
This example is the later, UK-only version.
It has, of course, far fewer controls and was sold as a straightforward
portable TV.
The tube is fairly conventional, although it uses electrostatic
deflection rather than the usual (for TV) magnetic deflection.
The same tube was used by the Sinclair instrument division (later
known as Thandar) in a <A HREF="scope.htm#SC110A">portable oscilloscope</A>.
</P>
<BR CLEAR=LEFT>
<H2>Sinclair FTV-1 Flat-screen TV</H2>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="sinctv2.jpg" ALT="Sinclair FTV-1" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=137>
<P>
The last of the Sinclair pocket TVs was the FTV-1, the flat-screen
model.
It has a very novel <ACRONYM TITLE="Cathode-Ray Tube">CRT</ACRONYM>
which reduces the thickness of the TV dramatically.
It fires the electron beam from one side (right, when the TV is held
normally) and deflects it to strike the phosphor screen from the
front.
The resulting picture is distorted, so there are two ingenious
correcting mechnisms.
One is an electronic scanning system that corrects for distortions
within the CRT, while the other is an anamorphic lens that corrects
the aspect ratio of the image.
The rest of the electronics has been reduced to little more than a
single chip, although the parts are not so small that they are
surface-mounted, as in a modern device.
Even the battery is novel, being a thin, flat 6-volt battery made
by Polaroid.
It was designed to go inside Polaroid instant film packs, but is
no longer obtainable as a replacement for the TV.
