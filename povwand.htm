There are lots of designs on the web for persistence-of-vision
<ACRONYM TITLE="Light-Emitting Diode">LED</ACRONYM>
displays,
some with motors and some hand-operated.
I happened to have a lot of green LEDs and some 18-core cable, so I made
one up in the form of a hand-held wand.
It has 16 LEDs soldered onto some square-pad prototyping board.
The LEDs are driven through 220&Omega; resistors from a pair of
74LS373 latch chips.
The resistors (which I got from the Bristol
<A HREF="http://www.freecycle.org">FreeCycle</A> list) are on the
upper left in the photo.
The two chips underneath the blue wiring on the
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadboard">solderless breadboard</A>
are the 74LS373s,
and the little green PCB module caries the
<A HREF="http://www.atmel.com">Atmel</A> ATmega8
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcontroller">microcontroller</A>.
The brown connectors on the far left of the breadboard go to the wand
itself, via the 18-core cable.
There are a few extraneous LEDs and transistors on the far side of the
breadboard, where I was experimenting with
<ACRONYM TITLE="Pulse-Width Modulation">PWM</ACRONYM> for controlling the
brightness of some blue LEDs.

The software in the Atmel AVR chip is entirely written in assembler.
The AVR is, like many microcontrollers, a
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_architecture">Harvard Architecture</A>
machine, which means that it has separate memories for program and data.
The program code is stored into the Flash memory by the AVRISP
programming tool,
while run-time data is stored into
<ACRONYM TITLE="Random-Access Memory">RAM</ACRONYM>
by the processor itself.
There's also some
<ACRONYM TITLE="Electrically Eraseable Programmable Read-Only Memory">EEPROM</ACRONYM>
on the chip, but this little program doesn't use it.
The source code is
<A HREF="pov.asm">here</A> (ASCII text format, 8kbytes).
</P>

I rushed the software a bit to get it ready for a friend's birthday party;
note the missing pixel on the bottom row!
I fixed it shortly afterwards, and the photos taken at
<A HREF="http://www.dorkbot.org/dorkbotbristol/">Dorkbot Bristol</A>
show the corrected version.
Also, note the four unused LEDs at the top of the pattern.
I have 16 LEDs, but I'm only using 12 of them for this pattern.
