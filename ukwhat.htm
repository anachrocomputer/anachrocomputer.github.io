Back in 1979, if you wanted a microcomputer there were a few
popular machines to choose from: the Apple ][, the Commodore PET,
the Tandy TRS-80 and many types of CP/M system.
However, if you couldn't afford a ready-built system, there was
always a kit computer: the
<A HREF="http://members.aol.com/mk14emu/">Science of Cambridge MK14</A>,
the
<A HREF="http://www.geoff.org.uk/microtan/index.htm">Tangerine</A>
or the
<A HREF="http://www.cary.demon.co.uk/acorn/">Acorn System One</A>.
These kits were very limited, having only a seven-segment
<ACRONYM TITLE="Light-Emitting Diode">LED</ACRONYM>
display, a hex keypad and perhaps 256 bytes of
<ACRONYM TITLE="Random-Access Memory">RAM</ACRONYM>.
You had to program them in machine code &#151 not in assembler,
but in raw hexadecimal machine code.
</P>
<P>
The UK101 was a kit computer that had a
<ACRONYM TITLE="Visual Display Unit">VDU</ACRONYM>,
a full alphanumeric keyboard,
4k bytes of memory and a built-in BASIC interpreter.
I bought one!
Of course, you could still program it in
<ABBR TITLE="hexadecimal">hex</ABBR> if you wanted to...

For many people in Britain, the UK101 was their first computer.
This was a time when computer clubs would meet to discuss the
finer points of BASIC programming, and you could be sure to
find somebody there who'd built and programmed a Compukit.
</P>
<P>
Magazines like
<A HREF="http://www.pcw.co.uk/">Personal Computer World</A>
published programs for
the Compukit alongside those for the PET and the Apple.
Hardware add-ons were available, mostly as kits, from several
suppliers.
Comp Shop, who sold the kits, always had a full-page advert
inside the back cover of magazines at the time.

After a while, new 8-bit designs arrived, like the BBC Micro, the
Oric-1 and the Dragon 32.
People began to see more and more of the strange new IBM PC.
Then, Apple launched the Macintosh, Atari produced the ST
and Commodore came out with the Amiga; all 16-bit machines
based on the Motorola 68000.
</P>
<P>
People put their Compukits away and moved on to something bigger.
I went for the
<A HREF="http://www.atari.st/">Atari&nbsp;ST</A>
as a home machine, while work centred
around the IBM&nbsp;PC.
Think of all the fortysomething software engineers, network analysts
and Web authors who started their computing careers with a cardboard
box full of chips carrying the name Compukit&nbsp;UK101!
