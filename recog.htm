<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>How To Recognise Computer Expansion Cards</H1>
<P>
People sometimes marvel at my ability to recognise a particular
type of computer add-on card and tell them what kind of computer
it was designed to plug into.
This page is an attempt to show a few examples, to help others
to spot classic computer parts amongst the dross.
</P>
<H2>Introduction</H2>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="ex1.jpg" WIDTH=400 HEIGHT=358>
Here's an example of a classic computer board, compared to two
modern PC add-on cards.
The big card is a disk controller from that most classic of
computers, the PDP-11; the card at top left is a network card for
a 16-bit
<ACRONYM TITLE="Industry Standard Architecture">ISA</ACRONYM>
bus slot, and the card at top right is a
<ACRONYM TITLE="Peripheral Card Interface">PCI</ACRONYM>
sound card.
The 10 megabit Ethernet cards are being thrown out by IT departments
all over the place.
PCI sound cards are available at computer fairs for a few pounds.
PDP-11 boards are irreplaceable examples of late 1970s technology,
and should be conserved with great care.

Now let's compare memory boards.
The large board here is a 32k byte memory board for a PDP-11;
the smaller board is a 256M byte
<ACRONYM TITLE="Dual Inline Memory Module">DIMM</ACRONYM>
for a modern PC.
Note the metal stiffener (at the bottom of the photo) and the lock
and eject levers on the much more substantial PDP-11 board.
The DIMM standard places the lock and eject levers on the PC
motherboard, and has no need of metal stiffeners.
The PDP-11 board holds 32768 bytes, while the DIMM holds
268435456 bytes, a factor of 8192 bigger.

<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>
So far, you might be drawing the conclusion that large boards are old,
classic and good, while small boards are new, modern and rubbish.
This is of course absolutely correct.
<H2>The Eight-Bit Generation</H2>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="acemem.jpg" WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=262>
Here's a rare one.
This is the board inside the 16k byte expansion module for the
Jupiter Ace.
Note the eight 4116
<ACRONYM TITLE="Dynamic Random-Access Memory">DRAM</ACRONYM>
chips, in 16-pin
<ACRONYM TITLE="Dual In Line">DIL</ACRONYM>
packages.
The chips have date codes &ldquo;8232&rdquo;, which means they were
made in the 32nd week of 1982.

<P>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="uk101ram.jpg" WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=195>
This memory board was produced by Watford Electronics in the early
1980s.
It was designed to be used with an expansion motherboard that could
be connected to several machines of that era.
I bought one and hard-wired it to my
<A HREF="uk101.htm">Compukit UK101</A>.
It holds 8k bytes (8192 bytes) of memory, in 16 2114 static RAM chips.
Once again, the RAM chips are in DIL packages (18 pin) and in this
case are in sockets.

Coming soon: Apple ][ and Apple /// expansion boards, BBC Micro
upgrades and Sinclair RAM packs.

<H2>The Acorn Archimedes</H2>
<P>
<IMG SRC="podule1.jpg" WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=200 ALT="Acorn Podule" ALIGN=RIGHT>
This expansion board is a video add-on Podule for an Acorn
Archimedes.
Note the DIN 41612 connector on the right-hand side, and the Acorn
mounting bracket on the left.

<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>
<H2>The IBM-Compatible PC</H2>
<P>
<IMG SRC="fastram.jpg" WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=120 ALT="AST Fastram" ALIGN=RIGHT>
Although this board looks like a normal IBM PC expansion card
(<ACRONYM TITLE="Industry Standard Architecture">ISA</ACRONYM> bus),
it's not.
It's actually an AST Fastram board, designed for use in special
RAM slots in AST 286 motherboards.
Note the additional gold-plated edge connector on the bottom
left-hand side of the board.
The RAM chips are 256k by 1-bit DRAMs, so the total capacity is
a staggering 2Mbytes.
Only the first 512kbytes are soldered in; the rest are in sockets and
have been added as upgrades.

<H2>Networking Devices</H2>
<P>
<IMG SRC="isdn.jpg" WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=178 ALT="ISDN board" ALIGN=RIGHT>
It's sometimes important to recognise when a board is not a
computer expansion card at all, but an add-on to something else.
This is a two-line
<ACRONYM TITLE="Integrated Services Digital Network">ISDN</ACRONYM>
interface for a small router.
On the underside, it has a DIN 41612 connector, a sure sign that this
is no PC add-on card.
The two small daughter boards (or should that be grand-daughter)
plug in to the main board.
All the major chips are embedded-systems versions of the 68000.
