<H2>About the Device</H2>
<P>
The iRiver H340 is a portable music player with a 40Gb, 2.5-inch hard
disk drive.
It has a headphone output, a line level output and both line input and a
built-in microphone.
There's a built-in FM radio, which can also be used as a recording
signal source.
</P>
<H2>The Fault</H2>
<P>
I acquired the H340 from FreeCycle, without any of the accessories.
I suspected that the lithium-ion battery had become discharged, so I
found a 5V power aupply and charged it up.
The H340 worked just fine, and I was able to use it to test some other
audio gear that I had also got from FreeCycle.
</P>
<P>
My mistake was to use the H340 to test a 70+70Watt in-car amplifier that
incorporates a step-up power supply.
Somehow, I connected the H340 to the amp while a large DC offset was
present at the input terminal.
This destroyed the headphone output on one channel.
Foolishly, I tried again with the line level output before realising
(with horror) what had happened.
So I now had an MP3 player with both line and headphone outputs dead on
the right channel.
</P>
<H2>The Fix</H2>
<P>
The unit can be opened up by unscrewing several tiny screws from the
case.
The H340 opens up to reveal the battery, hard disk drive, PCB and
some blue rubber shock-absorbing material.
</P>

<P>
There's a single chip for all of the digital-to-analog and analog-to-digital
functions, as well as acting as the headphone amplifier and line output driver.
Clearly, this is the chip that I'd blown up.
</P>
<P>
I obtained a replacement DAC/ADC chip, UDA1380TT, from RS Components, order code
484-1007.
It's a 32-pin surface-mount chip, 0.65mm lead pitch.
It sounds tiny, but it's not too difficult to solder with
a fine tip, good lighting and a stereo microscope.
I removed the defective chip by carefully cutting its leads off with a sharp
knife, before cleaning up the solder pads on the PCB.
</P>

Reassembly is the reverse of disassembly.
