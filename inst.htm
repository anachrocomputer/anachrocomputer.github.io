<H2>The Avo Model 8 Mark II</H2>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="avo2.jpg" ALT="Photo of Avo 8" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=237>
<P>
The classic British engineer's multimeter.
</P>
<P>
I have three of these, one of which has suffered damage at some time by
getting damp.
The cases are Bakelite, the dials have glass over them and the handles
are leather.
Internally, the shunts, multipliers and current transformers are all
made with brass and copper, and assembled by hand.
I've got a box and manual for one of them, too.
<A HREF="http://www.avo.co.uk/">AVO International</A>.

<H2>The Heavy Duty Avo</H2>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="avo3.jpg" ALT="Photo of Heavy Duty Avo" WIDTH=100 HEIGHT=150>
<P>
As if the Model 8 isn't heavy enough, here's a heavy duty
version of the classic Avo.
It's a much less common version, smaller than the standard
instrument, with just a single knob for selecting ranges.
It also has just two terminals for the test leads
(the Model 8 has four).
There is a small selector switch for use with the
"One Ohm Resistance Range Extension Unit".
My example has been dropped, broken, and carefully mended with
Araldite epoxy glue.
</P>
<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>
<H2>Siemens Ediswan Transistor Test Set Type R2285</H2>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="trans1.jpg" ALT="Photo of transistor tester" WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=112>
<P>
Slightly less than fully-featured by modern standards because
it can only test PNP transistors.
Powered by the now-obsolete PP4 battery (cylindrical, 9V,
press-stud on each end).
</P>
<BR CLEAR=LEFT>
<H2>The Telequipment Serviscope Minor</H2>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="scope2.jpg" ALT="Photo of Serviscope Minor" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=261>
A small, valve (vacuum tube) oscilloscope intended for use in
schools and colleges.
It's single channel, uncalibrated and has no provision for
external sync or timebase.
The date in the manual is 1966.
<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>
</P>
<H2>Telequipment D31R</H2>
<P>
The oldest Telequipment model I have,
and even the rectifier is valve.
The &#145;R&#146; suffix indicates that this is a
rack-mounting scope,
and the &#145;D&#146; prefix indicates dual-beam.
</P>
<P>
Most of these scopes are dual-beam but, unlike modern scopes,
they have two separate electron guns inside the tube,
each with its own pair of vertical deflection plates.
They also have two brightness
and two focus controls.
Modern dual-beam scopes have just a single electron gun and use a
multiplexing technique to produce two traces on the screen
(you sometimes see a &#145;chop/alternate&#146 button). 
</P>
<P>
Another special feature of these old scopes is the timebase stability control. You had to tweak it
just right to get the timebase to run. 
</P>
<H2>Telequipment D33</H2>
<P>
Slightly more modern version of the Telequipment scope,
this time in a benchtop case.
Again, dual-beam with two electron guns. 
</P>
<H2>The Telequipment D43R</H2>
<P>
Perhaps the ultimate development in valve scopes,
the &#145;43&#146; system was a range of scopes with
interchangeable plug-in modules. My copy of the manual is version 2.5,
dated November 1968 and
mentions that Telequipment is a member of the Tektronix group. 
</P>
<P>
The dual-beam models would accept any two vertical amplifier modules and there was also a
choice of timebase modules. Not only are there two brightness and focus controls, there are also
two astigmatism controls. 
Unlike modern dual-beam scopes, the D43's tube has two electron guns
and actually produces two beams of electrons.
Nowadays, tubes only have one gun and the beam is switched electronically
between channel A and channel B.
This is done either on alternate sweeps of the timebase (ALT mode)
or by a separate oscillator (CHOP mode).
</P>
<P>
I have two of these scopes, one of which has a long-persistance phosphor in the CRT and a special
slow timebase. 
The special phosphor glows blue when struck by the electron beam,
but the decaying trace is orange.
An orange filter then tones down the brightness of the spot while
leaving the afterglow unaffected, so you just increase the brightness
in order to get the long-persistence effect.
</P>
<H2>The Cossor Model 3332</H2>
<P>
This fine old scope was rescued from a sad fate at the local
dump in Weston-Super-Mare.
It is remarkable in that it contains only three valves, and
one of those is the rectifier!
It's in quite poor condition, and
I've never dared to apply power and see if it works.
Cossor is now part of <A HREF="http://www.raytheon.com">
Raytheon Electronic Systems</A>.
</P>
<H2>The Hewlett-Packard 1980B Oscilloscope Measurement System</H2>
<P>
A digitally-controlled analog scope!
It has an IEEE-488 (HP-IB) interface to allow the scope to be controlled
by a computer.
Internally, the scope has an
<A HREF="http://www3.sk.sympatico.ca/jbayko/cpu.html#8085">8085</A>
CPU to control all its functions
and to send and receive data on the IEEE interface.
The scope was introduced by HP in 1980.
</P>
<P>
I have two of these scopes, and one of them has a couple of optional
extras installed.
The first is the 19860 Digital Waveform Storage Option, which allows
the scope to digitise a waveform and store it in a memory (two
separate memories are provided).
The second option is the 19811A Plot/Sequence ROM,
which allows the scope to
drive an HPGL plotter through the IEEE interface in order to plot
stored waveforms.
It also adds a sort of "keyboard macro" capability to speed up
repetitive test sequences.
I'm looking for a manual for the 19860 option, as well as a plug-in
expansion module, HP part number 1950B, to turn the scope into
a four-channel version.
</P>
<H2>The Hewlett-Packard 5216A 12.5MHz Electronic Counter</H2>
<P>
Nice little digital counter and frequency meter with nixie tubes.
Circuits based on I.C.s, probably TTL.
Also has a rear-panel connector for interfacing with a computer,
although it pre-dates the HP-IB or IEEE-488 standards.
The instrument division of HP is now known as
<A HREF="http://www.agilent.com">Agilent</A>.
</P>
<H2>Denco Modulated Test Oscillator MTO 1</H2>
<P>
I was given this little RF signal generator when I visited the
Denco factory in Clacton in the 1970s.
It has a single valve (Mullard DL92) and requires a special
battery to supply both HT and heater voltages.
The frequency ranges are 170-475kHz and 550-1600kHz, which
covers the Medium Wave band nicely.
</P>
<H2>The Tektronix Type 191 Constant Amplitude Signal Generator</H2>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="tek2.jpg" ALT="Photo of Tektronix 191" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=133>
R.F. signal generator (350kHz-100MHz) featuring a bizarre GR874
hermaphrodite connector.
Hybrid circuit with both valves and transistors.
The &#145;constant amplitude&#146; just means that there's no
provision for amplitude modulating the signal.
<A HREF="http://www.tektronix.com/">Tektronix</A>.
<BR CLEAR=LEFT>
</P>
<H2>The Mullard <I>High Speed</I> Valve Tester</H2>
<P>
Amazing piece of technology incoporating a punched-card programming
arrangement to set the tester up for each type of valve.
There's also a lever, not unlike a fruit machine, to lock the
punched card in place and start the test.
The display is on a CRT, which is really under-utilised and
could have been replaced by a simple meter &#151; the machine was
built by Mullard, though, and they make CRTs!
One of the punched cards is a self-test card.
Probably built in the 1950s.
</P>
<H2>Solartron LM 1420.2 Digital Voltmeter</H2>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="nixie2.jpg" ALT="Photo of nixie tubes" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=139>
Another nixie tube instrument (see
photos of <A HREF="nixie4.jpg">side-viewed</A> and
<A HREF="nixie3.jpg">end-viewed</A> nixie tubes).
Seems to work by converting the incoming voltage into a frequency,
passing it through a transformer (for isolation), and then measuring
the frequency.
<A HREF="http://www.solartron.com/">Solartron</A>.
<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>
</P>
<H2>Solartron 1170 Frequency Response Analyser</H2>
<P>
More nixie tubes than you can shake a stick at!
The front panel lights up in a rather gratuitous manner, too.
The function of this device is a bit obscure, but it seems
to combine a swept signal generator with an AC millivoltmeter,
so that it can measure the frequency and phase response of an
amplifier.
</P>
<H2>Tektronix 833 Data Comm Tester</H2>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="tek833.jpg" ALT="Photo of Tek 833" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=192>
In the days before LANs and packet sniffers, data communications
were usually just simple RS-232 links, and the Tektronix 833 was
designed to debug them.
It's based on a
<A HREF="http://www3.sk.sympatico.ca/jbayko/cpu.html#6800">6800</A>
processor and it has switch-selectable baud
rates from 50 to 9600, including the IBM Selectric speed of 134.5 baud.
It has a built-in RS232 break-out box and can transmit and receive
test messages in ASCII and EBCDIC.
The display is a seven-segment LED, showing codes in hexadecimal.
<A HREF="http://www.tektronix.com/">Tektronix</A>.

</P>
<H2>ISOLAN Ethernet Test Set</H2>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="isolan1.jpg" ALT="Photo of Isolan" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=148>
Technology moves on, and we go from RS-232 to Ethernet.
This instrument is packaged in a fine little metal suitcase
and can be used to test both Ethernet transceivers and complete
Ethernet installations.
In fact, it's best suited to the so-called Cheapernet,
or thin Ethernet, system because it has a BNC socket for
the network connection.
