<H2>Multimeter</H2>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="meter.jpg" ALT="Multimeter" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=296>
<P>
My very first multimeter.
Acquired in the 1970s and still in use today.
I've had to repair and modify it, but it's still a useful instrument.
Note the rather oversized 4mm terminals, installed in place of the
original 2mm sockets that finally wore out a few years ago.
I also wanted to make the meter fit my other test leads, which are
all fitted with 4mm plugs.
Also visible are two allen bolts that hold the internal PCB in place.
The original self-tapping screws (into plastic) had long since pulled out,
leaving the range switch loose.
So, at the same time as fitting the 4mm sockets, I drilled out and fitted
the bolts.
At some stage in the past (I don't remember when) the rectifier for AC
voltage ranges failed, so that's now been replaced with a pair of
point-contact diodes.
A single AA battery powers the ohms range.

<H2>Siemens Ediswan Transistor Test Set Type R2285</H2>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="trans1.jpg" ALT="transistor tester" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=151>
<P>
Slightly less than fully-featured by modern standards because
it can only test PNP transistors.
Powered by the now-obsolete PP4 battery (cylindrical, 9V,
press-stud on each end).

<H2>Tektronix 575 Transistor Curve Tracer</H2>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="tek575.jpg" ALT="Tek 575" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=260>
<P>
If you really want to know about a transistor, this is the instrument
to use.
It displays the characteristic curves of the transistor on a cathode-ray
tube, just like an oscilloscope tube.
It can test the transistor up to 400 volts and 10 amps, and even more
with the add-on range extender.
It's quite easy to set the tester up to show thermal runaway in
germanium transistors.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the little Siemens test set, the Tek 575 is switchable
for both PNP and NPN transistors.
It has two transistor sockets on the sloping panel at the bottom,
along with a switch to rapidly swap them over for comparison testing.
</P>
Internally, the Tek 575 is a hybrid valve/transistor instrument,
and even includes some matched-pair valves.
It's built in the same size case as many of the Tektronix
oscilloscopes of its generation.
There's a big fan on the rear panel for cooling.

<H2>The Hewlett-Packard 5216A 12.5MHz Electronic Counter</H2>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="hp5216a.jpg" ALT="HP 5216A electronic counter" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=157>
<P>
Nice little digital counter and frequency meter with nixie tubes.
Circuits based on I.C.s, probably
<ACRONYM TITLE="Transistor-Transistor Logic">TTL</ACRONYM>.
Also has a rear-panel connector for interfacing with a computer,
although it pre-dates the
<ACRONYM TITLE="Hewlett-Packard Interface Bus">HP-IB</ACRONYM>
or IEEE-488 standards.

<H2>Hewlett-Packard logic probe and pulser</H2>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="hplogic.jpg" ALT="HP logic probes" WIDTH=250 HEIGHT=65>
<P>
Lovely set of logic debugging tools by the master of test gear, HP.
The three probes are (top to bottom) the 546A Logic Pulser, the 545A
Logic Probe and the 547A Current Tracer.
The tapered device on the left is the 548A Logic Clip.

<H2>Hewlett-Packard 5011T Logic Troubleshooting Kit</H2>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="hp5011t.jpg" ALT="HP 5011T" WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=197>
<P>
Another, older set of logic debugging tools in a handy plastic
carrying case.                               
The main tool is the 10529A Logic Comparator, complete with plug-in
personality modules for various logic chips, a universal module
and a self-test module.
The two probes are (top to bottom) the 10526T Logic Pulser
and the 10525T Logic Probe.
Again, the tapered device on the right is a Logic Clip, the 10528A.
The manuals for the kit are dated 1973.

<H2>Hewlett-Packard 1602A Logic State Analyser</H2>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="hp1602a.jpg" ALT="HP 1602A" WIDTH=250 HEIGHT=174>
<P>
The 1602A is an early type of logic analyser, dating from 1978.
It does not have a
<ACRONYM TITLE="Cathode Ray Tube">CRT</ACRONYM>
display (as the later analysers did) but it
just uses a row of seven-segment
<ACRONYM TITLE="Light-Emitting Diode">LED</ACRONYM>
displays (also made by HP).
In common with most HP kit of that era, the PCBs inside are fully
gold-plated.

The 1615A logic analyser features a
<ACRONYM TITLE="Cathode Ray Tube">CRT</ACRONYM>
display and a hex keypad.

<H2>The Ryley Automation TTL Logic Clip</H2>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="clip1.jpg" ALT="TTL Logic Clip" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=249>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="clip2.jpg" ALT="TTL Logic Clip box" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=252>
<P>
Rather like the HP548A Logic Clip, this is a UK-made gadget for testing the
logic levels on DIL chips.
It just clips over the chip and displays the logic levels on 16 red
<ACRONYM TITLE="Light-Emitting Diode">LED</ACRONYM>s.
Useful only for static or slowly-changing signals!
This model has the handy feature of a slider that can be set to show the IC pin
numbers for either 14-pin or 16-pin chips.
In the 14-pin mode, the bottom two LEDs are covered up with a black shutter.
I got this one from FreeCycle, complete with its original box and instructions.

<H2>The Gould K100D Logic Analyser</H2>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="k100d.jpg" ALT="Gould K100D" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=149>
This fine old logic analyser is a classic computer in its own right,
since it's powered by a Motorola
6800
CPU chip (the same chip as the Tektronix 833 comms tester).
Shame it doesn't work at the moment.

<H2>Farnell E350 Stabilised Power Supply</H2>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="e350.jpg" ALT="E350 power supply" WIDTH=250 HEIGHT=223>
<P>
A typical modern bench power supply might have a 0-6V output and
maybe a pair of 0-18V outputs.
The E350 has a single 0-350V output at a maximum of 100mA.
It also has a selection of AC valve heater outputs, which rather gives
away its age.
The circuit is hybrid, with a selection of semiconductor diodes and
transistors as well as an EL34 valve.

<H2>The Stag PPZ Universal PROM Programmer</H2>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="stagppz.jpg" ALT="Stag PPZ" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=94>
Another instrument that's powered by a classic computer, this time
the Motorola
6809.
I have two plug-in modules for the universal programmer mainframe,
the Zm2200 for PALs and the Zm2000 for PROMs and EPROMs.
I'd be keen to find some other plug-ins, or even just to find out
what plug-ins were available for this machine.
I regularly use this programmer for reading and programming EPROMs,
and have recently used it on PDP-11 boot PROMs.

<H2>Denco Modulated Test Oscillator MTO 1</H2>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="mto1.jpg" ALT="Denco MTO1" WIDTH=100 HEIGHT=121>
<P>
I was given this little RF signal generator when I visited the
Denco factory in Clacton in the 1970s.
It has a single valve (Mullard DL92) and requires a special
battery to supply both HT and heater voltages.
The frequency ranges are 170-475kHz and 550-1600kHz, which
covers the Medium Wave band nicely.

<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="hp3310a.jpg" ALT="HP3310A function generator" WIDTH=250 HEIGHT=156>
A very fine HP function generator from 1979.
Contains a mix of discrete transistors and metal-can ICs (741 op-amps)
on PCBs that are gold-plated all over.

<H2>The HP 3476B Multimeter</H2>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="hp3476b.jpg" ALT="HP3476B multimeter" WIDTH=250 HEIGHT=73>
I just couldn't resist this one when I saw it.
What a great example of Sci-Fi styling!
Another bit of HP kit from the 1970s, the era of the gold-plated PCBs.

<H2>The Sinclair DM2 Multimeter</H2>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="dm2.jpg" ALT="DM2 multimeter" WIDTH=350 HEIGHT=88>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="dm2_pcb.jpg" ALT="DM2 multimeter PCB" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=128>
Another multimeter, but this time a British one, by Sinclair.
Once again, a 3&frac12; digit DMM with LED display.
The main chip is an AY-5-3507, date coded 7706 (week 6 of 1977).
The case is made of quite thick steel, painted black all over.
There's a socket on the back for a mains adaptor, which will also charge
the internal batteries, if fitted.

<H2>The Sinclair PDM35 Multimeter</H2>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="pdm35.jpg" ALT="PDM35 multimeter" WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=298>
Another Sinclair multimeter, a few years later than the DM2.
It's housed in the same case as a Sinclair Oxford calculator, as is the PFM200A
frequency meter.

<H2>The Thandar PFM200A Frequency Meter</H2>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="pfm200a.jpg" ALT="PFM200A frequency meter" WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=307>
Again housed in a calulator case, this is Sinclair's frequency meter, re-badged
as a Thandar.

<H2>The Tektronix Type 191 Constant Amplitude Signal Generator</H2>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="tek191.jpg" ALT="Tektronix 191" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=124>
R.F. signal generator (350kHz-100MHz) featuring a bizarre GR874
hermaphrodite connector.
Hybrid circuit with both valves and transistors.
The &#145;constant amplitude&#146; just means that there's no
provision for amplitude modulating the signal.
In fact, these signal generators were sometimes used as scope
calibrators.
At last, I have an adaptor to plug into the GR874 connector to
convert it into the rather more useful BNC socket.

<H2>The Mullard <I>High Speed</I> Valve Tester</H2>
<P>
Amazing piece of technology incoporating a punched-card programming
arrangement to set the tester up for each type of valve.
There's also a lever, not unlike a fruit machine, to lock the
punched card in place and start the test.
The display is on a CRT, which is really under-utilised and
could have been replaced by a simple meter &#151; the machine was
built by Mullard, though, and they make CRTs!
One of the punched cards is a self-test card.
Probably built in the 1950s.

<H2>Solartron LM 1420.2 Digital Voltmeter</H2>
<P>
A nixie tube instrument (see
photos of <A HREF="nixie4.jpg">side-viewed</A> and
<A HREF="nixie3.jpg">end-viewed</A> nixie tubes).
Seems to work by converting the incoming voltage into a frequency,
passing it through a transformer (for isolation), and then measuring
the frequency.

<H2>Venner Digital Frequency Meter Type TSA3334</H2>
<P>
A digital frequency meter based entirely on discrete transistors.
They seem to be mostly Mullard OC44 and OC45 types.
The display is four digits, using the E.A.C. Digivisor.
The Digivisor is a moving-coil device which projects the image of
a digit onto a screen, according to the current flowing through it.
Each digit display is driven from a digital-to-analog convertor,
and the adjustments for these DACs are brought out the the rear
panel (two adjustments per digit).

<H2>Solartron 1170 Frequency Response Analyser</H2>

<P>
More nixie tubes than you can shake a stick at!
The front panel lights up in a rather gratuitous manner, too.
The function of this device is a bit obscure, but it seems
to combine a swept signal generator with an AC millivoltmeter,
so that it can measure the frequency and phase response of an
amplifier.

<H2>Tektronix 833 Data Comm Tester</H2>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="tek833.jpg" ALT="Tek 833" WIDTH=250 HEIGHT=237>
In the days before
<ACRONYM TITLE="Local Area Network">LAN</ACRONYM>s and packet sniffers,
data communications
were usually just simple RS-232 links, and the Tektronix 833 was
designed to debug them.
It's based on a Motorola
6800
processor and it has switch-selectable baud
rates from 50 to 9600, including the IBM Selectric speed of 134.5 baud.
It has a built-in RS232 break-out box and can transmit and receive
test messages in
<ACRONYM TITLE="American Standard Code for Information Interchange">ASCII</ACRONYM> and 
<ACRONYM TITLE="Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code">EBCDIC</ACRONYM>.
The display is a seven-segment LED, showing codes in hexadecimal.

<H2>ISOLAN Ethernet Test Set</H2>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="isolan1.jpg" ALT="Isolan" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=148>
Technology moves on, and we go from RS-232 to Ethernet.
This instrument is packaged in a fine little metal suitcase
and can be used to test both Ethernet transceivers and complete
Ethernet installations.
In fact, it's best suited to the so-called Cheapernet,
or thin Ethernet, system because it has a BNC socket for
the network connection.
