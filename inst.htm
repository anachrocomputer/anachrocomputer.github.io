<H2>Multimeter</H2>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="meter.jpg" ALT="Multimeter" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=296>
<P>
My very first <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimeter" TITLE="Wikipedia: Multimeter">multimeter</A>.
Acquired in the 1970s and still in use today.
I've had to repair and modify it, but it's still a useful instrument.
Note the rather oversized 4mm terminals, installed in place of the
original 2mm sockets that finally wore out a few years ago.
I also wanted to make the meter fit my other test leads, which are
all fitted with 4mm plugs.
Also visible are two allen bolts that hold the internal PCB in place.
The original self-tapping screws (into plastic) had long since pulled out,
leaving the range switch loose.
So, at the same time as fitting the 4mm sockets, I drilled out and fitted
the bolts.
At some stage in the past (I don't remember when) the rectifier for AC
voltage ranges failed, so that's now been replaced with a pair of
point-contact diodes.
A single AA battery powers the ohms range.

<H2>Tektronix 575 Transistor Curve Tracer</H2>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="tek575.jpg" ALT="Tek 575" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=260>
<P>
If you really want to know about a transistor, this is the
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor_curve_tracer" TITLE="Wikipedia: Semiconductor curve tracer">instrument</A>
to use.
It displays the characteristic curves of the transistor on a cathode-ray
tube, just like an oscilloscope tube.
It can test the transistor up to 400 volts and 10 amps, and even more
with the add-on range extender.
It's quite easy to set the tester up to show thermal runaway in
germanium transistors.
Apart from transistors, the instrument can test rectifier diodes and zener diodes.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the little Siemens test set, the Tek 575 is switchable
for both PNP and NPN transistors.
It has two transistor sockets on the sloping panel at the bottom,
along with a switch to rapidly swap them over for comparison testing.
This is how matched pairs of transistors were matched, before the process was automated.
</P>
Internally, the Tek 575 is a hybrid valve/transistor instrument,
and even includes some matched-pair valves.
My example was built at the Tektronix factory in Guernsey, in the Channel Islands.
It's built in the same size case as many of the Tektronix
oscilloscopes of its generation.
The case is so big and heavy that it has two carrying handles on top, implying that it's a two-person lift.
There's a big AC-powered fan on the rear panel for cooling, and a filter which must be cleaned regularly
(as the old Tek manuals used to say).

<P>
Another, older set of logic debugging tools in a handy plastic
carrying case.                               
The main tool is the 10529A Logic Comparator, complete with plug-in
personality modules for various logic chips, a universal module
and a self-test module.
The two probes are (top to bottom) the 10526T Logic Pulser
and the 10525T Logic Probe.
Again, the tapered device on the right is a Logic Clip, the 10528A.
The manuals for the kit are dated 1973.

<P>
A much newer and more sophisticated device for logic debugging is the HP
LogicDart.
This is one of my favourite HP gadgets, a hand-held logic analyser and tester
with an LCD display and three input channels.
It'll also measure voltage and frequency, as well as having a continuity
beeper and diode tester.

<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="hp1602a.jpg" ALT="HP 1602A" WIDTH=250 HEIGHT=174>
<P>
The 1602A is an early type of
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_analyzer" TITLE="Wikipedia: Logic Analyzer">logic analyser</A>,
dating from 1978.
It does not have a
<ACRONYM TITLE="Cathode Ray Tube">CRT</ACRONYM>
display (as the later analysers did) but it just uses a row of seven-segment
<ACRONYM TITLE="Light-Emitting Diode">LED</ACRONYM>
displays (made by the HP component division).
In common with most HP kit of that era, the PCBs inside are fully
gold-plated.

<BR CLEAR=LEFT>
<H2>Hewlett-Packard 1630G Logic Analyser</H2>

The 1630G logic analyser is a more sophisticated model than the 1615A, with more channels and more memory.

<P>
Rather like the HP548A Logic Clip, this is a UK-made gadget for testing the
logic levels on DIL chips.
It just clips over the chip and displays the logic levels on 16 red
<ACRONYM TITLE="Light-Emitting Diode">LED</ACRONYM>s.
Useful only for static or slowly-changing signals!
This model has the handy feature of a slider that can be set to show the IC pin
numbers for either 14-pin or 16-pin chips.
In the 14-pin mode, the bottom two LEDs are covered up with a black shutter.
I got this one from

This fine old logic analyser is a classic computer in its own right,
since it's powered by a Motorola
6800
CPU chip (the same chip as the Tektronix 833 comms tester).
Shame it doesn't work at the moment.

<H2>Farnell TOPS4D Triple-Output Power Supply</H2>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="tops4d.jpg" ALT="TOPS4D power supply" WIDTH=250 HEIGHT=151 -->
<P>
A very standard bench power supply from Farnell.
It has three outputs, one for digital logic 1.5-6V, 3A and two for analog
circuits, &plusmn;2-19V, 0.8A.
The two analog supplies are tracking; that is, they are controlled by a single knob
(the right-hand one) and are always equal in voltage but opposite in polarity.
Each supply has a separate toggle switch (black plastic rectangles in the photo)
that allows the user to first set up the supply with just the mains on,
then switch on the output(s) when required.
Of course, they're also handy for switching off in a hurry when things
go wrong!
The logic supply's ground is separate from the dual analog ground,
which is separate again from mains earth (which is connected to the green
socket on the front panel).
All the terminals are 4mm sockets.

<H2>Farnell E350 Stabilised Power Supply</H2>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="e350.jpg" ALT="E350 power supply" WIDTH=250 HEIGHT=223>
<P>
A typical modern bench power supply might have a 0-6V output and
maybe a pair of 0-18V outputs.
The E350 has a single 0-350V output at a maximum of 100mA.
It also has a selection of AC valve heater outputs, which rather gives
away its age.
The circuit is hybrid, with a selection of semiconductor diodes and
transistors as well as an EL34 valve.

<A NAME="PPZ">
<H2>The Stag PPZ Universal Programmer</H2>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="stagppz.jpg" ALT="Stag PPZ" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=94>
Another instrument that's powered by a classic computer, this time
the Motorola
6809.
The machine was built in 1984, according to the dates stamped inside.
I have two plug-in modules for the universal programmer mainframe,
the Zm2200 for PALs and the Zm2000 for PROMs and EPROMs.
In fact, I have two versions of the Zm2000, one with Revision&nbsp;36
firmware, the other with Revision&nbsp;37.
I'd be keen to find some other plug-ins, or even just to find a
full list of what plug-ins were available for this machine.
I've seen a Stag "Product Selection Guide" that lists the
Zm2300 Super PLD Module, the Zm2500 MOS Module, the Zm2800
Gang/Set Module and the Zm29xx Custom Module.
Were there any others?
I do know that there was a successor machine to the PPZ, the
Stag System 3000, which accepts the Zm3000 module.
</P>
<P>
I regularly use this programmer for reading and programming EPROMs,
such as the 2716 EPROMs used in the
<A HREF="uk101.htm">Compukit UK101</A>.
I've also used it to write 2716 EPROMs with 6809 code for use in a
<A HREF="sixadapt.htm">modified UK101</A>, fitted with a 6809 CPU.
More recently, I wrote some 27C128 EPROMs for a 6309-based
single-board computer that I bought from eBay.
The Zm2000 Module will also read and program bipolar PROMs,
which was useful when I wanted to work with PDP-11 boot PROMs.

<P>
I was given this little RF signal generator when I visited the
Denco factory in Clacton in the 1970s.
It has a single valve (Mullard DL92) and requires a special
battery to supply both HT and heater voltages.
The frequency ranges are 170-475kHz and 550-1600kHz, which
covers the Medium Wave band nicely.

<!-- ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="hp3476b.jpg" ALT="HP3476B multimeter" WIDTH=250 HEIGHT=73 -->
Another HP instrument that I just couldn't resist.
It's a 6&frac12; digit DVM that looks really impressive in a stack of test equipment.
The 3456A was designed without compromise for accuracy&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;it's not intended
for use outside the lab environment.
The instrument has an HP-IB (IEEE-488) interface and must be mains powered.
It has the distinction of being able to make resistance measurements using a
Kelvin connection (four-wire Ohms range).
However, it can only measure voltage and resistance; it has no current ranges.
Seems a bit silly to use it to test the AA batteries in the TV remote control...

Another bench DMM, this time with DC and AC current ranges (AC current was an optional
extra).
It's small enough to be used away from the bench, but has no batteries and consequently needs
a mains power supply.
Like many instruments here, it has an HP-IB (IEEE-488) interface on the back.
This instrument, like its counterpart, the

Once again, a 3&frac12; digit DMM with LED display.
The main chip is an AY-5-3507, date coded 7706 (week 6 of 1977).

Hybrid circuit with both valves and transistors.
The &#145;constant amplitude&#146; just means that there's no
provision for amplitude modulating the signal.
In fact, these signal generators were sometimes used as scope
calibrators.
At last, I have an adaptor to plug into the GR874 connector to

There's also a lever, not unlike a fruit machine, to lock the
punched card in place and start the test.
The display is on a CRT, which is really under-utilised and
could have been replaced by a simple meter &#151; the machine was

The display is four digits, using the E.A.C. Digivisor.
The Digivisor is a moving-coil device which projects the image of
a digit onto a screen, according to the current flowing through it.
Each digit display is driven from a digital-to-analog convertor,
and the adjustments for these DACs are brought out the the rear
