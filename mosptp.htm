<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>MOS Technology Paper Tape Format</H1>
The following information is taken from the KIM-1 User Manual,
published in August 1976 by MOS&nbsp;Technology, Inc. of Norristown, PA.
It appears as Appendix&nbsp;F of the KIM-1 manual and is reproduced here
exactly as in the original.

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>PAPER TAPE FORMAT</H2>
<P>
The paper tape LOAD and SAVE routines store and retrieve data in
a specific format designed to insure error free recovery.
Each byte of data to be stored is converted to two half bytes.
The half bytes (whose possible values are 0 to FF<SUB>HEX</SUB>)
are translated into their ASCII equivalents and written out onto
paper tape in this form.
</P>
<P>
Each record outputted begins with a ";" character (ASCII 3B) to mark
the start of a valid record.
The next byte transmitted (18<SUB>HEX</SUB>) or (24<SUB>10</SUB>) is
the number of data bytes contained in the record.
The record's starting address High (1 byte, 2 characters), starting
address Lo (1 byte, 2 characters), and data (24 bytes, 48 characters)
follow.
Each record is terminated by the record's check-sum
(2 bytes, 4 characters), a carriage return (ASCII 0D), line feed
(ASCII 0A), and six "NULL" characters (ASCII 00).
</P>
<P>
The last record transmitted has zero data bytes (indicated by ;00).
The starting address field is replaced by a four digit Hex number
representing the total number of data records contained in the
transmission, followed by the records usual check-sum digits.
A "XOFF" character ends the transmission.

<U>;00</U>0001<U>0001</U><BR>
</TT>
</P>
<P>
During a "LOAD" all incoming data is ignored until a ";" character
is received.
The receipt of non ASCII data or a mismatch between a records calculated
check-sum and the check-sum read from tape will cause an error condition
to be recognized by KIM.
The check-sum is calculated by adding all data in the record except the
";" character.
</P>
<P>
The paper tape format described is compatible with all other
MOS Technology, Inc. software support programs.
