<P>
This photograph of the Radio Lexden mixer desk was taken in about 1979,
when I was in the Sixth Form at the Colchester Royal Grammar School.
It shows the FM tuner, reel-to-reel tape deck, mixer, cassette deck,
microphone and two record decks.
Two valve amplifiers were housed separately in an old locker cabinet and
they fed the loudspeakers installed in the building.
The studios were located in the basement of Gurney Benham House, and
the name &#145;Radio Lexden&#146; can still be seen on the door,
although the station closed many years ago.
