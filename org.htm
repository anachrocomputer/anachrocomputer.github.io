The electronic organiser is a familiar device nowadays.
There's everything from a simple databank with an address book,
up to the likes of the Jornada, PalmPilot and iPaq.
Some of the older models, however, were quite innovative...

<H2>The Psion Organiser II</H2>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="psions.jpg" ALT="Three Psion IIs" HEIGHT=205 WIDTH=350>
<P>
This is the Psion Organiser II, models XP, CM and LZ64 (left to right).
They all have a 6303 microprocessor, an LCD, two slots for memory
cartridges and a connector for expansion.
The keyboard is calculator-like with the keys arranged alphabetically.
There's no &ldquo;off&rdquo; key &#151; the
machine is switched off by a menu command.
The case is also styled like a calculator, but it has a handy
slide-on cover (not shown in the photo) to keep the keyboard safe
when the machine is not in use.
<P>
The following Organiser II models were made:

The Organiser came with its own proprietary programming language, OPL
(for Organiser Programming Language).
It's a bit like a structured form of BASIC, and development tools were
available for the PC.

<H2>The Psion Organiser 3a</H2>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="psion3a.jpg" ALT="Photo of Psion 3a" HEIGHT=129 WIDTH=150>
<P>
The next model of the Psion Organiser had a quite different layout,
opening up to reveal a QWERTY keyboard.
This model's display is much more advanced, showing bit-mapped
graphics as well as text.
</P>
<P>
Psion announced in 2001 that they would no longer manufacture
personal organisers.

<H2>The Acorn Pocket Book II</H2>

Wait a minute, this is just a re-badged Psion Organiser 3a!

<H2>The AgendA</H2>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="agenda2.jpg" ALT="Photo of AgendA" HEIGHT=133 WIDTH=275>
<P>
The AgendA is another British-designed organiser from the mid-80s.
Its most striking feature is the microwriter keyboard.
As if to encourage the use of the microwriter, the conventional
keyboard is arranged alphabetically.
One of the main design goals was to extend battery life, and that
has certainly been achieved.
The built-in NiCds would last weeks on a single charge (when they
were new).
</P>
<P>
The microwriter is a descendant of the first chord keyboards,
pioneered by Doug Engelbart (inventor of the mouse).
Part of the innovation involved in the AgendA was a system of mnemonics
to assist in learning the chords.
Once the user had learnt the basics, it was possible to move on to
more advanced uses of the chord keyboard including a full set
of single-chord commands for the machine.

<H2>The Microwriter</H2>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="mwrite.jpg" ALT="Microwriter" WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=294>
<P>
The original Microwriter was not an organiser but a writing machine
designed by Cy Endfield and first sold in 1980.
It was intended to be used as a text input device, as well as
to help the disabled to communicate.
It could only show a single line of text on its built-in LED display,
but it had interfaces to external display and storage devices.
The photo shows a later model with a one-line LCD, released
in 1982.
</P>
<P>
A review of the first version appeared in Personal Computer
World magazine in December 1980, and a review of the improved
version appeared in September 1982.
Both versions sold for &pound;500.
</P>
<P>
The case is much bulkier than the AgendA, with most of the extra
thickness being taken up by the four NiCd batteries.
These are fitted into the body of the machine, under the user's
palm, but are a non-standard size and soldered into place!
The CPU is an

</P>
<P>
Both the AgendA and the Microwriter suffer from the problem
of what to do for left-handed users.

<H2>The Apple Newton</H2>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="newton.jpg" ALT="Photo of Apple Newton" WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=242>
<P>
The Newton was Apple's entry into the personal organiser
market, launched in 199?.
It was an amazingly innovative machine at the time, having no
keyboard at all but a touch-sensitive screen with handwriting
recognition.
It also introduces the idea of having a handheld computer as an
accessory to a desktop machine, with data being transferred
between the two.

<H2>The Amstrad PenPad 600</H2>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="penpad.jpg" ALT="Photo of Amstrad PenPad" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=169>
<P>
Amstrad's low-cost answer to the Apple Newton.
Quite a neat book-like design, with a cover flap opening to reveal
LCD on the right and operating instructions on the left.
There's a groove on the back where the stylus clips in.
It runs on three AA batteries.

<H2>The HP 95LX</H2>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="hp95.jpg" ALT="Photo of HP 95LX" WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=151>
<P>
This HP organiser is also an 8088-based PC compatible machine, running
MS-DOS.
Well, it's PC compatible up to the size of the video display, which
has been reduced.
But, if you can get MS-DOS programs (.EXE files) onto it, it'll
run them quite nicely on two AA batteries.
It also has a non-IrDA infra-red port and a PCMCIA slot.
Introduced in 1990.

<H2>The HP OmniGo 100</H2>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="omnigo.jpg" ALT="Photo of HP OmniGo" WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=188>
<P>
HP's stylus-based organiser of 1995.
Uses the same "Graffiti" modified letter-forms as the PalmPilot.
Also has a clever square screen that can operate either way
round.

<H2>The Philips Nino</H2>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="nino.jpg" ALT="Photo of Philips Nino" WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=239>
<P>
Philips made their stylus-based machine in 1998.
It has a slot for Compact Flash (CF) cards, as well as a voice-memo
recording feature.
Like the Palm Pilot, it has a drop-in docking station for connection
to a host PC.
The processor in the Nino is a 75MHz
<A HREF="http://www3.sk.sympatico.ca/jbayko/cpu4.html#Sec4Part5">MIPS</A>
chip, which runs the Windows CE operating system.
However, if you prefer Linux, there's always this

<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="n9110.jpg" ALT="Photo of Nokia 9110" WIDTH=275 HEIGHT=183>
<P>
The Nokia 9110 is a puzzle; is it an Old Organiser or a
<A HREF="mobile.htm#9110">Massive Mobile</A>?
Well, I suppose it's both.
The photo shows it opened up into its organiser mode.
The processor is a 486, and the OS is GEOS.
