<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Evolution of the Game Pad</H1>
<P>
I was looking at some classic game console joypads the other day,
and I began wondering how their features developed over the years,
So, here's a first draft of a history of the joypad, in roughly
chronological order.
</P>
<H2>The TV Tennis Game Paddle</H2>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="jpbinatone.jpg" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=74 ALT="Binatone TV game controller">
An analogue control based on the monostable and triggered by
the frame sync pulse.
Game-start buttons often located on the console, not on the
paddles.
Some TV games didn't even put the paddles on wires, but placed
them on the front of the game box itself.
One particularly odd machine in this respect was the Videomaster
Superscore, which not only mounted the controls on the front
of the console,
but it also used roller-style controls.
Another slightly strange option was the use of slider controls,
such as those on the Commodore TV Game.
Generally, there were no buttons on the paddles.
Need photos: Commodore slider paddle.
</P>
<H2>The Atari 2600 Joystick</H2>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="jp2600.jpg" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=208 ALT="2600 Joystick">
A digital, four-way joystick with a single fire button.
Introduced in October 1977 with the Atari Video Computer System (VCS),
later renamed the Atari 2600.
Set the standard in joysticks and interface connectors for many years.
Again, game-start controls on the console itself.
Need photos: Quick Shot joystick.
</P>
<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="jpswitch.jpg" WIDTH=140 HEIGHT=204 ALT="Switch Joystick">
Many manufacturers made Atari-compatible joysticks with four direction
switches and a fire button.
Here's an example in clear plastic, where the user can see the four
high-quality microswitches at the bottom of the stick.
Shame they didn't use a microswitch for the fire button, too.
</P>
<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>
<H2>The Atari 7800 Joystick</H2>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="jp7800.jpg" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=108 ALT="7800 Joystick">
A digital, four-way joystick with two fire buttons.
Simply adds an extra fire button to the 2600 joystick.
The wiring is cleverly arranged to maintain compatibility with
the older 2600 joystick, with just a couple of resistors forming
a crude OR gate.
My example is missing the screw-in stick, but still functions
as a joypad.
Buttons are labelled &lsquo;1&rsquo; and &lsquo;2&rsquo;.
</P>
<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>
<H2>Oddity: The Foot-operated Joystick</H2>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="jpfoot.jpg" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=152 ALT="QJ Footpedal">
A peculiar gadget, the QJ Footpedal System was designed to work with
the Atari joysticks and other compatible machines.
It has three foot-operated switches, as well as a set of configuration
switches.
You could set it up to operate a driving game, presumably.
QJ model SV-129, patent pending.
</P>
<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>
<H2>The 8-bit Home Computer Joystick</H2>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="jpvoltmace.jpg" WIDTH=100 HEIGHT=210 ALT="Voltmace Joystick">
An analog joystick with a single fire button.
Many UK gamers would remember the
<ACRONYM TITLE="British Broadcasting Corporation">BBC</ACRONYM>
Micro and its 15-pin analog port,
which was usually used for a joystick.
However, other machines had similar (but incompatible) ports,
such as the Dragon 32.
Games were generally started from the
<ACRONYM TITLE="Beginners' All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code">BASIC</ACRONYM>
interpreter of the machine, using the keyboard.
Need photos: Dragon joystick, Apple ][ paddle.
</P>
<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>
<H2>The Vectrex Joystick</H2>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="jpvec.jpg" WIDTH=250 HEIGHT=112 ALT="Vectrex Joystick">
An analog joystick with four buttons.
The Vectrex was an 8-bit, vector-scan console introduced in 1982.
It had two controller ports, and each controller had an analog
joystick (sprung to centre) and four buttons.
The function of the buttons was shown on the screen overlay.
Games were started from the controller using the normal fire buttons.
The four buttons are labelled &lsquo;1&rsquo; to &lsquo;4&rsquo;.
</P>
<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>
<H2>The Nintendo Entertainment System Joypad</H2>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="zapper.jpg" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=125 ALT="NES Zapper">
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="jpnes2.jpg" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=147 ALT="NES Advantage">
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="jpnes.jpg" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=94 ALT="NES Joypad">
A digital joypad with two game-start buttons and two fire buttons.
First used on the Nintendo Family Computer of 1983, and later
sold around the world as the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)
from 1986.
The NES joypad introduces the idea of placing active components
and circuitry inside the joypad.
Each joypad has an 8-bit
<ACRONYM TITLE="Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor">CMOS</ACRONYM>
shift register chip in it (the 4021)
and the console contains hardware to communicate with it.
This reduces the number of wires required in the cable from
nine (one per button, plus ground) to just five.
However, the NES has a seven-pin connector
(the two extra pins were for the light gun).
The shape of the game pad, however, is a very basic rectangular box.
The two fire buttons are labelled &lsquo;A&rsquo; and &lsquo;B&rsquo;.
</P>

<H2>The Sega Master System Joypad</H2>
<P>
The Sega Master System was a Z80-based console, but I don't have one!
</P>
<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>
<H2>The Super Nintendo Entertainment System Joypad</H2>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="snes.jpg" WIDTH=250 HEIGHT=151 ALT="SNES Mouse">
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="jpsnes.jpg" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=111 ALT="SNES Joypad">
A digital joypad with two game-start buttons and six fire buttons.
The SNES joypad extends the 8-bit shift register of the NES to
16 bits, although only 12 bits were actually used.
Exactly the same interface circuit will read a SNES pad as was
used for the NES, simply clocking the shift register 12 times
instead of eight.
There's also a different connector on the SNES pad, but the same number
of active wires in the cable: five.
It also introduces the idea of shoulder buttons, and it is shaped
much more naturally to fit the player's hands.
</P>

<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="jpdualt.jpg" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=113 ALT="Acclaim Dual Turbo">
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="jpwheel.jpg" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=197 ALT="Logic3 FreeWheel">
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="jpscorem.jpg" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=148 ALT="SNES Score Master">
Like the NES, an arcade-style joystick was available, called the
Score Master.
I also have an infra-red cordless controller called the Dual Turbo,
make by Acclaim.
It takes four AAA batteries in each controller.
For driving games, I have a FreeWheel controller by Logic 3,
which uses mercury switches to sense rotation and tilting of
a steering wheel.
All the usual SNES buttons are present, for game starting and
functions such as gear changing.
Finally, there's the SNES Mouse, supplied with Mario Paint.
It's a fairly ordinary two button opto-mechanical mouse with
a SNES interface.
</P>
<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="jpsnes2.jpg" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=265 ALT="SNES Joypad in PlayStation style">
Here's an example of one game system's design influencing another.
It's a SNES joypad, but built in the style of a PlayStation
joypad.
I found it in a charity shop in Bristol, in its original
packaging.
</P>
<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>
<H2>The Sega Mega Drive Joypad</H2>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="jpmega.jpg" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=124 ALT="Sega Mega Drive Joypad">
The Sega Mega Drive was a 68000-based console, and its joypad had three
fire buttons.
The game-start controls on this machine are reduced to a single
&lsquo;Start&rsquo; button.
</P>
<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>
<H2>The Sony PlayStation I Joypad</H2>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="jpps1.jpg" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=127 ALT="PS1 Joypad">
A digital joypad with two game-start buttons and eight fire buttons.
The PlayStation controller adds more shoulder buttons to the SNES pad,
as well as having a even more ergonomic shape.
The interface to the console involves a complex protocol but only
a few wires.
</P>
<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="jpneocon.jpg" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=118 ALT="Namco Neocon controller for PlayStation">
Here's an alternative controller for the original PlayStation,
used mainly for driving games.
It's the NeoCon, made by Namco.
The controller has a spring-loaded twisting joint in the middle,
which lets the player twist the two halves of the controller in
opposite directions.
This controls the steering in a driving game, while the two red
buttons are analog sensors and can control throttle and brake.
The two shoulder buttons are also analog.
</P>
<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>
<H2>The Nintendo Virtual Boy Joypad</H2>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="jpvb.jpg" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=175 ALT="Virtual Boy Joypad">
A digital joypad with two game-start buttons, two fire buttons and
two directional control pads.
The Virtual Boy controller is unusual in that it also incorporates
the machine's batteries (AA size cells), making it rather heavy.
Introduced in 1995, the machine was not a great success.
</P>
<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>
<H2>The Sega Saturn Joypad</H2>
<P>
<!-- ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="jpps1.jpg" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=127 ALT="PS1 Joypad" -->
The Sega Saturn controller takes a different approach to reducing
the number of wires, by adding a multiplexer.
This scheme was introduced in November 1994.
The console sends
<ACRONYM TITLE="Transistor-Transistor Logic">TTL</ACRONYM>-level
signals to the joypad in order to select
which of several button inputs will be sent back.
Eight button inputs can be read in this manner.
</P>
<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>
<H2>The Nintendo 64 Joypad</H2>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="jpn64.jpg" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=143 ALT="N64 Joypad">
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="jpn64b.jpg" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=196 ALT="N64 Joypad">
A bizarre three-handled controller, available in several bright colours
in addition to the standard grey.
Introduced in 1996 and featuring both a digital direction pad and
an analogue joystick.
Again, a complex signalling protocol between console and controller.
An optional vibration pack was available that clipped onto the back
of the controller.
Power for the vibration effect was supplied by a battery in the pack,
probably because the motor would draw too much current from the
joypad's 3.3V supply.
The other photo is a third-party controller in black with a quite
different design from the original N64 version.
Not visible in the photos is the trigger-like fire button located
underneath the controller and labelled Z.
</P>
<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>
<H2>The Sony PlayStation II Joypad</H2>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="jpps2.jpg" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=131 ALT="Sony PlayStation II joypad">
An update to the PlayStation I controller that adds
analog controls and a pair of vibration motors.
The two motors are fitted with eccentic weights of different
sizes, and can be independently controlled by the game.
For a great example of this, try the game &lsquo;Rez&rsquo;.
</P>
<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>
<H2>The Sega Dreamcast Joypad</H2>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="jpdream2.jpg" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=146 ALT="Dreamcast Arcade Stick">
The Dreamcast controller includes a slot for the memory card and
another slot for an add-on vibration pack.
The controls are both analog and digital.
Like the NES and SNES, an arcade-style joystick was available
as an option.
</P>
<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>
<H2>The Nintendo GameCube Joypad</H2>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="jpgc.jpg" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=157 ALT="GameCube Joypad">
We come right up-to-date with the GameCube controller, which has
both analog and digital controls as well as a vibration motor.
Same bit-level protocol as the N64 controller, but sends and
receives more bits (25 bits to the controller, 65 bits to the
console).
Power for the vibration motor is supplied separately at 5V,
eliminating the battery that was used in the N64 version.
</P>

<H2>The Microsoft Xbox Joypad</H2>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="jpxbox.jpg" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=152 ALT="Xbox Joypad">
The controllers for the Microsoft Xbox have started some
controversy over their size.
The U.S. and European controllers are larger than the Japanese
version, and some people find the larger type too big.
The interface is USB, but with a non-standard connector (a
common theme with game controllers).
Wireless controllers are available for the Xbox in addition to
the standard wired types.
</P>
<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>
<H2>The Microsoft Xbox 360 Joypad</H2>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="jpx360.jpg" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=145 ALT="Xbox 360 Joypad">
The standard controllers for the Microsoft Xbox 360 are wireless,
but the photo shows the optional wired type.
Not visible in the photo are the two shoulder buttons,
in addition to the two triggers.
On the front of the controller, there's a tiny connector for
what looks like a jack plug (centre) and two two-pin plugs
(left and right).
The "X" logo lights up to indicate which of the four players
this controller belongs to.
The black and white buttons of the old Xbox controller are not
present on the Xbox 360 version.
Also missing are the two connectors for memory modules.
The interface is USB, and the vendor/product ID is 045E:028E.
</P>

<H2>Hand-held Game Controls</H2>
<P>
Hand-held games tend to have slightly simpler controls than the TV-based
consoles.
There's usually a four-way joypad and just two fire buttons.
Did any hand-held ever include a tilt-operated control?
Or a shake-operated one?

<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>
<H2>The Nintendo Game Boy</H2>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="jpgb.jpg" WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=236 ALT="Game Boy Joypad">
The Z80-based Game Boy was first produced in 1989 and was the machine
that popularised the game of Tetris.
It has the same controls as the NES, namely a four-way joypad, two
fire buttons and two game-control buttons.
There's no need here to minimise the wiring between joypad and game
<ACRONYM TITLE="Central Processing Unit">CPU</ACRONYM>,
simply because they're both in the same box.
It's powered by four AA-size cells (the Game Boy Pocket only needed
two AAA-size cells).
My example is one of the brightly-coloured versions that were produced.
</P>
<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>
<H2>The Nintendo Game Boy Color</H2>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="jpgbc.jpg" WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=247 ALT="Game Boy Color Joypad">
The Game Boy was updated to incorporate a colour display,
and named the Game Boy Color.
Same controls as the earlier version, just a direction pad,
two fire buttons (&lsquo;A&rsquo; and &lsquo;B&rsquo;) and
two game-control buttons (&lsquo;Select&rsquo; and &lsquo;Start&rsquo;).
It's powered by two AA-size cells.
My example is one of the brightly-coloured versions.

<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>
<H2>The Game Park GP32</H2>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="jpgp32.jpg" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=122 ALT="Game Park GP32">
Right up-to-date now with the ARM-based GP32 from Game Park in Korea.
Very similar control setup to the Game Boy, though, with Start, Select,
A, B and two shoulder buttons, as well as a four-way joypad.
</P>
<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>
<H2>The Nintendo Game Boy Advance SP</H2>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="jpgba.jpg" WIDTH=140 HEIGHT=253 ALT="Game Boy Advance SP">
Staying with modern hand-helds, and the ARM chip, this is the Nintendo
Game Boy Advance SP.
My example is the retro-styled version that imitates the original
NES joypad.
The controls are familiar from the earlier Game Boy, with the addition
of two shoulder buttons (not visible in the photo).
