<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Evolution of the Game Pad</H1>
<P>
I was looking at some classic game console joypads the other day,
and I began wondering how their features developed over the years,
So, here's a first draft of a history of the joypad, in roughly
chronological order.
</P>
<H2>The TV Tennis Game Paddle</H2>
<P>
An analogue control based on the monostable and triggered by
the frame sync pulse.
Game-start buttons often located on the console, not on the
paddles.
Some TV games didn't even put the paddles on wires, but placed
them on the front of the game box itself.
One particularly odd machine in this respect was the Videomaster
Superscore, which not only mounted the controls on the front
of the console,
but it also used roller-style controls.
Another slightly strange option was the use of slider controls,
such as those on the Commodore TV Game.
Generally, there were no buttons on the paddles.

<H2>The Atari 2600 Joystick</H2>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="jp2600.jpg" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=208 ALT="2600 Joystick">
A digital, four-way joystick with a single fire button.
Introduced in October 1977 with the Atari Video Computer System (VCS),
later renamed the Atari 2600.
Set the standard in joysticks and interface connectors for many years.
Again, game-start controls on the console itself.
Need photos: Original 2600 joystick, Quick Shot joystick.

<H2>The Atari 7800 Joystick</H2>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="jp7800.jpg" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=108 ALT="7800 Joystick">
A digital, four-way joystick with two fire buttons.
Simply adds an extra fire button to the 2600 joystick.
The wiring is cleverly arranged to maintain compatibility with
the older 2600 joystick, with just a couple of resistors forming
a crude OR gate.
My example is missing the screw-in stick, but still functions
as a joypad.
Buttons are labelled &lsquo;1&rsquo; and &lsquo;2&rsquo;.

<H2>Oddity: The Foot-operated Joystick</H2>
<P>
<!-- ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="jp7800.jpg" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=108 ALT="7800 Joystick" -->
A peculiar gadget, the QJ Footpedal System was designed to work with
the Atari joysticks and other compatible machines.
It has three foot-operated switches, as well as a set of configuration
switches.
You could set it up to operate a driving game, presumably.
</P>
<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>
<H2>The 8-bit Home Computer Joystick</H2>
<P>
An analog joystick with a single fire button.
Many UK gamers would remember the
<ACRONYM TITLE="British Broadcasting Corporation">BBC</ACRONYM>
Micro and its 15-pin analog port,
which was usually used for a joystick.
However, other machines had similar (but incompatible) ports,
such as the Dragon 32.
Games were generally started from the
<ACRONYM TITLE="Beginners' All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code">BASIC</ACRONYM>
interpreter of the machine, using the keyboard.
Need photos: BBC Voltmace joystick, Dragon joystick, Apple ][ paddle.
</P>
<H2>The Vectrex Joystick</H2>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="jpvec.jpg" WIDTH=250 HEIGHT=112 ALT="Vectrex Joystick">
An analog joystick with four buttons.
The Vectrex was an 8-bit, vector-scan console introduced in 1982.
It had two controller ports, and each controller had an analog
joystick (sprung to centre) and four buttons.
The function of the buttons was shown on the screen overlay.
Games were started from the controller using the normal fire buttons.
The four buttons are labelled &lsquo;1&rsquo; to &lsquo;4&rsquo;.

<H2>The Nintendo Entertainment System Joypad</H2>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="zapper.jpg" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=125 ALT="NES Zapper">
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="jpnes2.jpg" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=147 ALT="NES Advantage">
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="jpnes.jpg" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=94 ALT="NES Joypad">
A digital joypad with two game-start buttons and two fire buttons.
First used on the Nintendo Family Computer of 1983, and later
sold around the world as the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)
from 1986.
The NES joypad introduces the idea of placing active components
and circuitry inside the joypad.
Each joypad has an 8-bit
<ACRONYM TITLE="Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor">CMOS</ACRONYM>
shift register chip in it (the 4021)
and the console contains hardware to communicate with it.
This reduces the number of wires required in the cable from
nine (one per button, plus ground) to just five.
However, the NES has a seven-pin connector
(the two extra pins were for the light gun).
The shape of the game pad, however, is a very basic rectangular box.
The two fire buttons are labelled &lsquo;A&rsquo; and &lsquo;B&rsquo;.
</P>

<H2>The Super Nintendo Entertainment System Joypad</H2>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="jpsnes.jpg" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=111 ALT="SNES Joypad">
A digital joypad with two game-start buttons and six fire buttons.
The SNES joypad extends the 8-bit shift register of the NES to
16 bits, although only 12 bits were actually used.
Exactly the same interface circuit will read a SNES pad as was
used for the NES, simply clocking the shift register 12 times
instead of eight.
There's also a different connector on the SNES pad, but the same number
of active wires in the cable: five.
It also introduces the idea of shoulder buttons, and it is shaped
much more naturally to fit the player's hands.
</P>

<H2>The Sega Saturn Joypad</H2>
<P>
<!-- ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="jpps1.jpg" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=127 ALT="PS1 Joypad" -->
The Sega Saturn controller takes a different approach to reducing
the number of wires, by adding a multiplexer.
This scheme was introduced in November 1994.
The console sends
<ACRONYM TITLE="Transistor-Transistor Logic">TTL</ACRONYM>-level
signals to the joypad in order to select
which of several button inputs will be sent back.
Eight button inputs can be read in this manner.
</P>
<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>
<H2>The Sony PlayStation I Joypad</H2>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="jpps1.jpg" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=127 ALT="PS1 Joypad">
A digital joypad with two game-start buttons and eight fire buttons.
The PlayStation controller adds more shoulder buttons to the SNES pad,
as well as having a even more ergonomic shape.
The interface to the console involves a complex protocol but only
a few wires.
</P>
<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>
<H2>The Nintendo Virtual Boy Joypad</H2>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="jpvb.jpg" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=175 ALT="Virtual Boy Joypad">
A digital joypad with two game-start buttons, two fire buttons and
two directional control pads.
The Virtual Boy controller is unusual in that it also incorporates
the machine's batteries (AA size cells), making it rather heavy.
Introduced in 1995, the machine was not a great success.
</P>
<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>
<H2>Hand-held Game Controls</H2>
<P>
Hand-held games tend to have slightly simpler controls than the TV-based
consoles.
There's usually a four-way joypad and just two fire buttons.
Did any hand-held ever include a tilt-operated control?
Or a shake-operated one?

<H2>The Nintendo Game Boy</H2>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="jpgb.jpg" WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=236 ALT="Game Boy Joypad">
The Z80-based Game Boy was first produced in 1989 and was the machine
that popularised the game of Tetris.
It has the same controls as the NES, namely a four-way joypad, two
fire buttons and two game-control buttons.
There's no need here to minimise the wiring between joypad and game
<ACRONYM TITLE="Central Processing Unit">CPU</ACRONYM>,
simply because they're both in the same box.
It's powered by four AA-size cells (the Game Boy Pocket only needed
two AAA-size cells).
My example is one of the brightly-coloured versions that were produced.

<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>
<H2>The Nintendo 64 Joypad</H2>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="jpn64.jpg" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=143 ALT="N64 Joypad">
A bizarre three-handled controller, available in several bright colours.
Introduced in 1996 and featuring both a digital direction pad and
an analogue joystick.
Again, a complex signalling protocol between console and controller.
An optional vibration pack was available that clipped onto the back
of the controller.
My example is actually a third-party controller with a quite
different design from the original N64 version.
</P>
<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>
<H2>The Sony PlayStation II Joypad</H2>
<P>
An update to the PlayStation I controller that adds (I think)
analog controls and a pair of vibration motors.
</P>
<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>
<H2>The Sega Dreamcast Joypad</H2>
<P>
The Dreamcast controller includes a slot for the memory card and
another slot for an add-on vibration pack.
The controls are both analog and digital.
</P>
<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>
<H2>The Nintendo GameCube Joypad</H2>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="jpgc.jpg" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=157 ALT="GameCube Joypad">
We come right up-to-date with the GameCube controller, which has
both analog and digital controls as well as a vibration motor.
Same bit-level protocol as the N64 controller, but sends and
receives more bits (25 bits to the controller, 65 bits to the
console).
