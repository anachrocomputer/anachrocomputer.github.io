Here's a selection of British telephones from that in-between
stage of development when Bakelite was obsolete but cell-phones
were still in the future.
Don't forget that the telephone system in the UK was a monopoly,
run by the Post Office (GPO) until the 1980s.
Ordinary customers ("subscribers") were not allowed to plug in
their own phones, nor were they allowed to connect modems.

Perhaps the best-known "luxury" phone was the Trimphone.
It was introduced in 1969, and made by STC.
Of course, you couldn't buy one, you had to rent it from the GPO.
It had an electronic ringer, a glow-in-the-dark dial and was
available in a variety of colours.

Later models of the Trimphone were made with pushbutton dialling
(both pulse and tone versions).
The final design was "enhanced" by having a leather covering stuck on.
This slightly naff leather-clad model was called the Deltaphone.

<H2>Ericofon</H2>

From Sweden came the Ericofon, made by
<A HREF="http://www.ericsson.se/">Ericsson</A>.
Yes, the same company that's now well-known for their cell phones,
DECT phones and mobile internet access.
My example of the Ericofon is the newer, push-button version.
Note that even though the user can dial quickly on the
push-buttons, the phone stores the digits and slowly pulse-dials
them onto the line.
All British push-button phones of this era had to pulse-dial,
and were much more complicated electronically as a result than
tone-dialling phones.
</P>
<P>
It's fitted with a 5-pole jack plug, which the GPO used to connect
non-standard phones (the usual connection was permanent wiring to
a junction box).
The photo below shows the bottom of the phone, where the dial is
located.
The red rectangular projections are the tips of the switch that
"hangs up" the phone when it's not in use.

This phone is popular enough to have its own Web site,

<H2>Monitel</H2>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="monitel1.jpg" ALT="Photo of Monitel" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=308>
Telephone call charging in the days of electromechanical exchanges
was a tricky business.
Calls were metered in "units" according to duration, distance
and time of day.
Then, subscribers were billed by charging for units at a certain rate.
A gadget called the Monitel was invented in the 1970s to show a
running display of how much, in pence, a call was costing.
Of course, it had to be programmed with the tariff, that is, how
many seconds to a unit (for each of the three distance bands) and how
much each unit cost in pence.
For this, the Monitel had a crude punched-card reader built-in.
</P>
<P>
The other problem was the GPO monopoly, which prevented the Monitel
from connecting in any way with the phone or the line.
So, the user first had to find out which charging rate applied to
the call (by distance, "Local", "a" or "b" rate) and then start the
counter when the call was connected.
The Monitel knew the time of day, and day of the week, and then used
the tariff information to display the cost of the call on a green
fluorescent display.
</P>
<P>
The whole device was shaped to fit exactly underneath a standard GPO
phone and was moulded in the same colours as the GPO offered.
My example is cream in colour.
