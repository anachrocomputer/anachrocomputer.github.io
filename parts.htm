<A NAME="Nixie">
<H2>Nixie Tubes</H2>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="nixie5.jpg" ALT="Nixie tube" WIDTH=90 HEIGHT=200>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="nixie6.jpg" ALT="Nixie tube" WIDTH=175 HEIGHT=200>
Nixie Tubes were invented by Burroughs as a means to display numerical
information.
They are basically neon lamps, with the electrodes carefully
shaped to represent digits.
Some nixie tubes were made with symbols instead of digits,
usually A, V and &Omega; to represent Volts, Amps and Ohms respectively
(for use in electronic test instruments).
They were also sometimes called Numicators.
These displays seem to be getting popular again nowadays, as part
of the nixie tube clock.
One can buy kits of parts to build a clock with nixie tubes for
the display.
You can see some more detail in these
photos of <A HREF="nixie4.jpg">side-viewed</A> and
<A HREF="nixie3.jpg">end-viewed</A> nixie tubes.
For a contemporary description of nixie tubes, see the article in
Scientific American, <CITE>Electronic Numbers</CITE>, June 1973,
page 66.

<H2>TIL311 Hex LED Display</H2>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="til311.jpg" ALT="TIL311 display" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=273>
A numerical display comprising a seven-segment
<ACRONYM TITLE="Light-Emitting Diode">LED</ACRONYM>
display and a binary decoder chip.
The chip (at the bottom of the package) accepted four binary bits,
representing a number from zero to 15.
It then displayed that number on the LEDs, using the hexadecimal digits
A-F for the (decimal) numbers 10 to 15.
Parts like this caused the demise of the nixie tube (above).

<H2>Semiconductors In Coloured Epoxy</H2>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="chiphues.jpg" ALT="Chips in coloured epoxy" WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=179>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="chiphues2.jpg" ALT="Chips in coloured epoxy" WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=201>
Normally, chips, transistors and diodes are packaged in black
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoxy" TITLE="Wikipedia: Epoxy">epoxy</A>
for protection from the environment, especially from corrosion due to moisture.
But these chips are clearly not in black epoxy, but white, grey
and green (there's a black one, too, for comparison).
Going from left to right (in the right-hand photo), there's a 4N38A optocoupler (white),
an RC555DN timer (grey), an HP2631 dual optocoupler (black)
and in the bottom row, two 2SA1385 PNP transistors (green).
The grey 555 chip is date coded &ldquo;7416&rdquo;, meaning the 16th
week of 1974.
The left-hand photo shows even more colour variation: diodes in red.
The transistors show the common marking convention for Japanese parts,
in that the &ldquo;2S&rdquo; prefix is omitted.
I've seen a few other examples of power transistors in green epoxy,
and optocouplers are commonly in white epoxy.
Power transistors in grey are very common and not really peculiar
enough for this page.
</P>
<P>
But the real questions is <B>why?</B>
Why do semiconductor manufacturers offer optocouplers in white
(it's an ordering option on the datasheet)?
Why are power transistors sometimes green?
And are the green ones always PNP bipolar transistors or P-channel FETs?

<H2>High Stability Resistors</H2>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="histab.jpg" ALT="High Stability resistors" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=133>
Special &ldquo;High Stability&rdquo; resistors with an extra pink band (sometimes
called &ldquo;salmon&rdquo;) to indicate their superior quality.
From left to right, a modern 4.7k&Omega; for comparison, a 68k&Omega;,
a 3.3k&Omega;, two 56k&Omega;, a 220k&Omega; and a 2.7k&Omega;.
All are 5% tolerance (gold band) apart from the 56k&Omega;, which
are 2% tolerance (red band).
The modern resistor is a metal film type, but the older ones are carbon
composition.
They were wax coated for moisture-proofing.

<H2>Plessey Castanet Capacitors</H2>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="castanet_ad.jpg" ALT="castanet capacitor" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=318>
These capacitors were made by Plessey, probably in the early 1970s.
I have only one of these capacitors, removed from a surplus
<ACRONYM TITLE="Printed Circuit Board">PCB</ACRONYM>
many years ago.
The advertisement (with the spelling mistake) is by
Henry's Radio of Edgware Road, London.

<H2>PAL Delay Line</H2>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="paldelay.jpg" ALT="PAL Delay Line" WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=268>
A PAL delay line, containing a quartz block and two transducers.
Now that analog TV using the European
<ACRONYM TITLE="Phase Alternate Line">PAL</ACRONYM>
system is becoming obsolete, we'll see fewer of these iconic components.
Every PAL TV had one, to act as an analog memory for one scan-line of
the TV signal.
One scan-line is equivalent to 64&mu;s, and that's how long the delay line
was.
They worked acoustically, converting the electrical video signal into
vibrations in the quartz block, and then converting it back after the
signal had been reflected off the far end of the block.
In the photo, I've removed the blue plastic cover to show the internals
of the device.

<H2>Rockwell Piggyback Chip</H2>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="r6511.jpg" ALT="R6511" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=75>
A Rockwell R65/11EB chip.
The socket on the back of the chip is for an
<ACRONYM TITLE="Erasible Programmable Read-Only Memory">EPROM</ACRONYM>
to be fitted.                        
The EPROM would contain the code for the program under development,
and would emulate the mask-programmed ROM of the final version.

<H2>AM27256 EPROM Chip</H2>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="27256a.jpg" ALT="AM27256 EPROM" WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=326>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="27256b.jpg" ALT="AM27256 EPROM die" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=187>
This isn't all that peculiar, but it's now old enough that some people will
never have seen one in a computer.
It's a 27256
<ACRONYM TITLE="Erasible Programmable Read-Only Memory">EPROM</ACRONYM>,
made by AMD in 1985.
This size of chip can store 256Kbits, organised as 32768x8bits.
EPROM chips are non-volatile memories, that is,
they retain their data even when the power is switched off.
They are erased by exposure to
<ACRONYM TITLE="Ultra-Violet">UV</ACRONYM> light, which is the
reason for the quartz window in the top of the chip package.
The irridescent colours visible in the close-up photo are due to the
features on the chip being small enough to act as a diffraction grating.
</P>
<P>
EPROMs have now been almost entirely superceded by Flash ROMs,
which are electrically erasible.

<H2>Knife Switch</H2>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="ksw.jpg" ALT="Knife switch" WIDTH=250 HEIGHT=121>
<P>
A porcelain knife switch, used for disconnecting an aerial (antenna)
from a radio receiver.
The two centre terminals of the switch are connected to the antenna
and the two left-hand terminals go to the radio.
Finally, the two terminals on the right are earthed.
The switch incorporates two spark-gaps which are intended to prevent
lightning from damaging the radio.
But the real protective measure is to switch the handle over to
the earthed position whenever the radio is not in use.
This disconnects the aerial from the radio, and connects it
directly to earth.

<H2>Quadrant Fader</H2>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="qfader.jpg" ALT="Quadrant Fader" WIDTH=250 HEIGHT=200>
<P>
On
<ACRONYM TITLE="British Broadcasting Corporation">BBC</ACRONYM>
mixing desks of the 1960s and 1970s, you'll find faders that
have a curved track, unlike the flat slider of more recent mixers.
These are quadrant faders, and they were built as professional-grade
devices for broadcast use.
The whole fader can be unplugged from the mixer for maintenance or
replacement (note the locating pins on the left-hand side).
It functions as an attenuator, with the slider selecting different
levels of attenuation at each step, although the steps cannot be
felt by the user.
The scale is marked in <ABBR TITLE="deciBels">dB</ABBR> and is
illuminated by two small bulbs.
There are two microswitches, set to switch at the very ends
of the fader's travel.

<A NAME="Scanner">
<H2>Scanner Image Sensor Chip</H2>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="scanchip.jpg" ALT="Scanner image sensor chip" WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=120>
<P>
This is the image sensor chip from an HP ScanJet 3300C flat-bed scanner.
The actual silicon image sensor is about 45mm long and 0.5mm wide.
All the connections are brought out at the very ends of the chip.
It's well worthwhile, if you can find such a chip, to have a look at it
under magnification.
A comparatively low-power stereo microscope (a &ldquo;dissecting microscope&rdquo;)
is best, but a strong magnifying lens may be sufficient.
Some types of scanner sensor chip have three stripes of colour filters
on them (red, green and blue) which show up as very vivid colours when
magnified.
Under each stripe is a row of light sensing photo-diodes that convert the
image into electrical signals.

<H2>Mobile Phone Camera Chip</H2>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="phonecam.jpg" ALT="Phone Camera" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=189>
This is the image sensor chip and associated lens from a Nokia
7250i cameraphone.
It has 14 connections, arranged in two rows of seven gold-plated
square pads, on the back of the ceramic package.
It just plugs into a receptacle inside the phone.
For scale, the squares in the background are 5mm.

<A NAME="EM84">
<H2>Magic Eye Valves</H2>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="mageye.jpg" ALT="Magic Eye" WIDTH=250 HEIGHT=93>
<P>
This example of a magic eye valve is a Telefunken EM84.
Magic eyes were used in valve circuits as record-level indicators,
tuning indicators and null indicators.
They work rather like a <ACRONYM TITLE="Cathode-Ray Tube">CRT</ACRONYM>,
in that they have a phosphor coating on the inside of the glass
envelope, which glows when struck by electrons.
In the CRT, the electrons are in a finely focused beam, but in the
magic eye, they cover a wide area.
Hence, a wide strip of phosphor will glow (green) when the valve
is working.
The length of the glowing strip is controlled by the voltage on
one of the electrodes inside the valve.
Much smaller valves were also made (DM160) that simply lit up,
and did not have any means to vary the size of the glow -- a sort
of digital version of the magic eye.

<H2>Glass Envelope Crystal</H2>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="xtal.jpg" ALT="Xtal" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=94>
Crystal in glass valve-like envelope.
Modern quartz crystals are housed in metal cans, but this older
example is in a glass envelope.
Unlike a valve, it does not have a &ldquo;getter&rdquo;, a metallised
area around the top of the valve that chemically reacts with any
remaining air inside.
Therefore, it probably doesn't have a vacuum inside, but it may be
filled with an inert gas, such as nitrogen.
It was made by Marconi, and its frequency is 333.333kc/s (or kHz
in modern units).

<H2>Glass Envelope Photoresistor</H2>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="orp.jpg" ALT="ORP" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=86>
Photo-sensitive resistor in glass valve-like envelope.
This is a Mullard part, made in Holland, but the part number has
rubbed off (apart from the ORP prefix).
The gold fingers are the two electrodes that make contact with the
light-sensitive material inside the glass envelope.

These are tiny miniature valves (vacuum tubes), housed in metal
cans only slightly bigger than TO5 transistors.

Its design allows two connectors to be mated face-to-face,
by simply meshing the metal &ldquo;petals&rdquo;.
