Some of the more unusual parts, old and new, from my collection.

<A NAME="Nixie">
<H2>Nixie Tubes</H2>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="nixie5.jpg" ALT="Nixie tube" WIDTH=90 HEIGHT=200>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="nixie6.jpg" ALT="Nixie tube" WIDTH=175 HEIGHT=200>
Nixie Tubes were invented by Burroughs as a means to display numerical
information.
They are basically neon lamps, with the electrodes carefully
shaped to represent digits.
Some nixie tubes were made with symbols instead of digits,
usually A, V and &Omega; to represent Volts, Amps and Ohms respectively
(for use in electronic test instruments).
They were also sometimes called Numicators.
These displays seem to be getting popular again nowadays, as part
of the nixie tube clock.
One can buy kits of parts to build a clock with nixie tubes for
the display.
You can see some more detail in these
photos of <A HREF="nixie4.jpg">side-viewed</A> and
<A HREF="nixie3.jpg">end-viewed</A> nixie tubes.
For a contemporary description of nixie tubes, see the article in
Scientific American, <CITE>Electronic Numbers</CITE>, June 1973,
page 66.

<H2>TIL311 Hex LED Display</H2>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="til311.jpg" ALT="TIL311 display" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=273>
A numerical display comprising a seven-segment LED display and
a binary decoder chip.
The chip (at the bottom of the package) accepted four binary bits,
representing a number from zero to 15.
It then displayed that number on the LEDs, using the hex digits
A-F for the (decimal) numbers 10 to 15.
Parts like this caused the demise of the nixie tube (above).

<H2>High Stability Resistors</H2>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="histab.jpg" ALT="High Stability resistors" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=133>
Special &ldquo;High Stability&rdquo; resistors with an extra pink band (sometimes
called &ldquo;salmon&rdquo;) to indicate their superior quality.
From left to right, a modern 4.7k&Omega; for comparison, a 68k&Omega;,
a 3.3k&Omega;, two 56k&Omega;, a 220k&Omega; and a 2.7k&Omega;.
All are 5% tolerance (gold band) apart from the 56k&Omega;, which
are 2% tolerance (red band).
The modern resistor is a metal film type, but the older ones are carbon
composition.
They were wax coated for moisture-proofing.

<H2>Rockwell Piggyback Chip</H2>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="r6511.jpg" ALT="R6511" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=75>
A Rockwell R65/11EB chip.
The socket on the back of the chip is for an EPROM to be fitted.
The EPROM would contain the code for the program under development,
and would emulate the mask-programmed ROM of the final version.
<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>
</P>
<H2>Knife Switch</H2>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="ksw.jpg" ALT="Knife switch" WIDTH=250 HEIGHT=121>
<P>
A porcelain knife switch, used for disconnecting an aerial (antenna)
from a radio receiver.
The two centre terminals of the switch are connected to the antenna
and the two left-hand terminals go to the radio.
Finally, the two terminals on the right are earthed.
The switch incorporates two spark-gaps which are intended to prevent
lightning from damaging the radio.
But the real protective measure is to switch the handle over to
the earthed position whenever the radio is not in use.
This disconnects the aerial from the radio, and connects it
directly to earth.

<H2>Quadrant Fader</H2>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="qfader.jpg" ALT="Quadrant Fader" WIDTH=250 HEIGHT=200>
<P>
On
<ACRONYM TITLE="British Broadcasting Corporation">BBC</ACRONYM>
mixing desks of the 1960s and 1970s, you'll find faders that
have a curved track, unlike the flat slider of more recent mixers.
These are quadrant faders, and they were built as professional-grade
devices for broadcast use.
The whole fader can be unplugged from the mixer for maintenance or
replacement (note the locating pins on the left-hand side).
It functions as an attenuator, with the slider selecting different
levels of attenuation at each step, although the steps cannot be
felt by the user.
The scale is marked in <ABBR TITLE="deciBels">dB</ABBR> and is
illuminated by two small bulbs.
There are two microswitches, set to switch at the very ends
of the fader's travel.

<H2>Scanner Image Sensor Chip</H2>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="scanchip.jpg" ALT="Scanner image sensor chip" WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=120>
<P>
This is the image sensor chip from an HP ScanJet 3300C flat-bed scanner.
The actual silicon image sensor is about 45mm long and 0.5mm wide.
All the connections are brought out at the very ends of the chip.

<H2>Mobile Phone Camera Chip</H2>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="phonecam.jpg" ALT="Phone Camera" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=189>
This is the image sensor chip and associated lens from a Nokia
7250i cameraphone.
It has 14 connections, arranged in two rows of seven gold-plated
square pads, on the back of the ceramic package.
It just plugs into a receptacle inside the phone.
For scale, the squares in the background are 5mm.

<A NAME="EM84">
<H2>Magic Eye Valves</H2>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="mageye.jpg" ALT="Magic Eye" WIDTH=250 HEIGHT=93>
<P>
This example of a magic eye valve is a Telefunken EM84.
Magic eyes were used in valve circuits as record-level indicators,
tuning indicators and null indicators.
They work rather like a <ACRONYM TITLE="Cathode-Ray Tube">CRT</ACRONYM>,
in that they have a phosphor coating on the inside of the glass
envelope, which glows when struck by electrons.
In the CRT, the electrons are in a finely focused beam, but in the
magic eye, they cover a wide area.
Hence, a wide strip of phosphor will glow (green) when the valve
is working.
The length of the glowing strip is controlled by the voltage on
one of the electrodes inside the valve.
Much smaller valves were also made (DM160) that simply lit up,
and did not have any means to vary the size of the glow -- a sort
of digital version of the magic eye.

<H2>Glass Envelope Crystal</H2>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="xtal.jpg" ALT="Xtal" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=94>
Crystal in glass valve-like envelope.
Modern quartz crystals are housed in metal cans, but this older
example is in a glass envelope.
Unlike a valve, it does not have a &ldquo;getter&rdquo;, a metallised
area around the top of the valve that chemically reacts with any
remaining air inside.
Therefore, it probably doesn't have a vacuum inside, but it may be
filled with an inert gas, such as nitrogen.
It was made by Marconi, and its frequency is 333.333kc/s (or kHz
in modern units).

<H2>Glass Envelope Photoresistor</H2>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="orp.jpg" ALT="ORP" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=86>
Photo-sensitive resistor in glass valve-like envelope.
This is a Mullard part, made in Holland, but the part number has
rubbed off (apart from the ORP prefix).
The gold fingers are the two electrodes that make contact with the
light-sensitive material inside the glass envelope.

<A NAME="Nuvistor">
<H2>Nuvistors</H2>
These are tiny miniature valves (vacuum tubes), housed in metal
cans only slightly bigger than TO5 transistors.
As used in the four-channel plug-in Y amplifier for the
Tektronix <A HREF="scope.htm#Tek564B">564B</A> storage scope.

<H2>GR874 Connector</H2>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="gr874a.jpg" ALT="GR874 end view" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=238>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="gr874b.jpg" ALT="GR874 side view" WIDTH=347 HEIGHT=238>
<P>
The
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GR_connector" TITLE="Wikipedia: GR connector">GR874</A>
hermaphrodite connector was introduced by General Radio for high-frequency RF test gear.
Its design allows two connectors to be mated face-to-face,
by simply meshing the metal &ldquo;petals&rdquo;.
This example is actually a
GR874-to-<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BNC_connector" TITLE="Wikipedia: BNC connector">BNC</A>
adaptor that I use on my
