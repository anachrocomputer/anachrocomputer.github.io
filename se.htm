I was introduced to the Software Tools Subsystem on the Prime P750
at Westfield College (University of London) in 1981.
We were all given login accounts on the Prime, which ran a multi-user
operating system called Primos.
But the college wanted a more Unix-like environment, so they
installed Software Tools and told everybody to type &lsquo;swt&rsquo; as
soon as they had logged in.
This started up Software Tools, and gave access to the Screen Editor.
</P>
<P>
The Screen Editor was written as an improved version of the
Software Tools line editor, &lsquo;ste&rsquo;.
It accepted all the same commands as the line editor, but it
displayed a full screen of text and gave much better feedback to the user.
</P>
<P>
Remember that the first version of this program was written in 1980!
</P>
<P>
Here at last is version 2.10 of the Software Tools Screen Editor,
better known as <B>se</B>.
I've finally got round to combining the eight different versions
that have been lying around on various machines (and Exabyte tapes)
for years!
What I havn't yet done is to make any fixes or improvements to the
code&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;that'll happen in version 2.20.
</P>
<P>
One very handy thing that this version includes is documentation
in HTML.
Not only can you read and print out <B>se</B> docs with your
browser, you can read them on-line <A HREF="sedocs.htm">here</A>.

Without further ado, here are the source code archives:

And a more up-to-date version with some of the older, 16-bit
hosts removed.  Better support for HTML, PHP and other modern
languages, though:
