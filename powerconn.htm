I use solderless breadboards for many of my circuits, at least in the
early stages of the design.
To connect the circuit to the power supply, I simply cut short lengths
of solid-core wire and connect them with crocodile clip leads.
The wire I use usually comes from a piece of telecoms cable which
had many twisted pairs in one outer sheath,
As for the crocodile clips, they present something of a hazard for short
circuits, and they often pull the wires out of the breaboard.
So, I was on the lookout for a better way to do it.

I had a number of old wire-wrap sockets which I'd saved from somewhere
(probably someone who was throwing them out), and some of them were
a bit broken.
I took one of those sockets and cut off four pins.
They were low-profile turned-pin wire-wrap sockets, which meant that it
was easy to cut them into smaller sections as required.
Two of the pins, I then trimmed back, leaving the other two pins at the
full length (to plug into the breadboard).
I soldered some wire to the pins and attached a cable tie for a bit
of strain relief.
On the other end, I fitted some 4mm plugs to suit my power supply.
In all, I made up four cables, enough for circuits that need positive
and negative supplies (op-amps) as well as a 5V logic supply.
