<H2>The AVO Model 8 Mark II</H2>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="avo8.jpg" ALT="AVO 8" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=243>
<P>
The classic British engineer's multimeter.
</P>
<P>
I have three of these, one of which has suffered damage at some time by
getting damp.
The cases are Bakelite, the dials have glass over them and the handles
are leather.
Internally, the shunts, multipliers and current transformers are all
made with brass and copper, and assembled by hand.
I've got a box and manual for one of them, too.

<H2>The Heavy Duty AVO</H2>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="avohd.jpg" ALT="Heavy Duty AVO" WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=204>
<P>
As if the Model 8 isn't heavy enough, here's a heavy duty
version of the classic AVO.
It's a much less common version, smaller than the standard
instrument, with just a single knob for selecting ranges.
It also has just two terminals for the test leads
(the Model 8 has four).
There is a small selector switch for use with the
"One Ohm Resistance Range Extension Unit".
My example has been dropped, broken, and carefully mended with
Araldite epoxy glue.
</P>
<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>
<H2>The AVO Model 12</H2>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="avo12.jpg" ALT="AVO Model 12" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=147>
<P>
This very unusual AVO was designed for use on vehicle electrical systems,
and has accessories to match.
The voltage ranges are 9, 18 and 36V DC, which match nicely with 6,
12 and 24V battery charging systems (a 12V car battery will be charged
at slightly more than 12V).
The current ranges are 3.6A and 36A, much heavier than the 250&mu;A
range of the Model&nbsp;8.
</P>
<BR CLEAR=LEFT>
<H2>The Electronic AVO Model EA113</H2>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="ea113.jpg" ALT="AVO EA113" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=175>
<P>
Another unusual model, the Electronic Avometer (EA113) incorporates
an amplifier to increase the sensitivity of the instrument.
It could be used on high impedance circuits without affecting either
the operation of the circuit or the reading of the meter.
The ordinary AVOs could not do this, but we tend to forget these
details nowadays when all multimeters have sensitive amplifiers.
This meter also has a wonderfully colourful case, in blue instead of
AVO's usual black.
</P>
<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>
<H2>The AVO Multiminor Mark 5</H2>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="avomm.jpg" ALT="AVO Multiminor" WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=231>
<P>
This is a smaller version of the AVO meter, complete with leather
case and test leads.
My example is in black bakelite, but they were also available in
a very fine grey finish.
Some models had brown leather cases, while other more recent cases
were vinyl.
</P>
<BR CLEAR=LEFT>
<H2>The AVO Clamp Meter</H2>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="avocl.jpg" ALT="AVO Clamp Meter" WIDTH=180 HEIGHT=318>
<P>
This AVO is primarily designed to measure large AC currents, but
can also measure voltage and resistance.
The &ldquo;jaws&rdquo; of the clamp meter are opened by squeezing the
trigger on the left-hand side.
Once clamped around a cable, the meter (in AC current mode) acts like
a transformer.
A current is induced in the secondary of the transformer, according
to the current flowing in the primary.
This induced current drives the meter.
The full-scale current ranges are 300A, 600A and 1200A, while the
voltage ranges are 150V, 300V, and 600V.
The meter can't measure DC voltage or current at all,
but to measure Ohms, an add-on probe can be used.

<H2>The AVO Transistor Test Set TT166</H2>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="avo166.jpg" ALT="AVO TT166" WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=207>
<P>
AVO made other types of instruments than just multimeters; this
example is a test set for transistors.
It can measure a transistor's gain, leakage and offset voltage.
Power is supplied by two 9V batteries.
</P>
<BR CLEAR=LEFT>
<H2>The AVO Transistor Tester TT169</H2>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="avo169.jpg" ALT="AVO TT169" WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=207>
<P>
Much smaller than the TT166, this AVO transistor tester works with the
transistor in-circuit.
</P>
<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>
<H2>The AVO Test Bridge</H2>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="avobr1.jpg" ALT="AVO Bridge" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=224>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="avobr2.jpg" ALT="AVO Bridge" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=229>
<P>
This instrument is the traditional Wheatstone Bridge, used to measure
resistance and capacitance.
The single valve is a triode, type L63, in an octal valveholder.
</P>
<BR CLEAR=LEFT>
<H2>The AVO Electronic Testmeter</H2>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="avoel.jpg" ALT="AVO Electronic Testmeter" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=268>
<P>
A strange AVO test gadget based on valves.
I think it works as a valve voltmeter, but like the Model&nbsp;8,
it has many functions.
One of the modes makes it into a wattmeter, and in that mode it
has selectable load impedances.
All the range-switching information appears in the two windows at
the bottom, back-lit by small lamps inside the instrument.
The control knobs have transparent plastic discs attached, with
the mode and range information engraved on them in black.

<H2>The Digital AVO Model DA212</H2>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="avo212.jpg" ALT="AVO DA212" WIDTH=180 HEIGHT=298>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="avo212a.jpg" ALT="AVO DA212" WIDTH=90 HEIGHT=152>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="avo212b.jpg" ALT="AVO DA212" WIDTH=90 HEIGHT=149>
<P>
An AVO with an LCD instead of the traditional moving-coil pointer.
