<H2>About the Device</H2>
<P>
The Delta Ultrasonic Cleaner is a mains-powered ultrasonic cleaning
tank.
It has a stainless steel tank with a plastic lid and on/off controls.
</P>
<H2>The Fault</H2>
<P>
I was given the cleaning tank as a "fix-it" project.
The main fuse would blow as soon as the "on" button was pressed.
</P>
<P>
Closer examination of the PCB revealed that the unit is powered by simply
rectifying and smoothing the 240V AC mains.
An auxiliary supply operates a relay that connects power to the ultrasonic
oscillator, driver transistors and transducer.
At this point, I suspected that the driver transistors were faulty.
</P>
<H2>The Fix</H2>
<P>
The two driver transistors, BU406 parts in TO-220 packages, were shorted.
<P>
I obtained two replacement transistors, from Farnell, order code
980-1782.
They were easy to desolder and replace, with just a normal soldering iron.
The transistors were bolted to two fairly large heat-sinks.
</P>
<P>
Reassembly is the reverse of disassembly.
