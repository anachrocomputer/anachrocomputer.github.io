<H2>About the Device</H2>
<P>
The Nintendo DS is a portable video game machine with two LCD screens.
The processor is an ARM chip.
</P>
<H2>The Fault</H2>
<P>
The DS failed to switch on and failed to respond when connected to a charger.
At first, I suspected the lithium-ion battery, but that appeared to be OK
when tested.
With a bit of searching, I found that a common failure mode is the
on-board fuse(s).
These fuses are surface-mount parts, soldered to the main PCB in the machine.
</P>
<P>
Referring to a
<A HREF="http://www.fixya.com/support/t340808-nintendo_ds_f2_blown">web-page that describes the fault</A>, I tested the fuses.
Sure enough, one of them had failed.
</P>
<H2>The Fix</H2>
<P>
The unit can be opened up by unscrewing several tiny screws from the
case.
Most of these screws are so-called "tri-wing" screws, intended to thwart
the repairer.
I had recently acquired a tri-wing screwdriver from Deal Extreme,
<A HREF="http://www.dealextreme.com/details.dx/sku.19861">SKU 19861</A>.
It fitted the screw heads very well.
Note that two of the screws are hidden under the rubber feet of the machine,
on the same edge as the screen hinge.
<P>
There are two fuses in the DS, but in my case only F2 had blown, a 750mA
0603 size fuse.
</P>
<P>
I obtained a replacement fuse from Farnell.
It's a tiny part, but solderable with a very fine tip, good lighting
and a stereo microscope.
</P>
<P>
Reassembly is the reverse of disassembly.
