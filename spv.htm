The Orange SPV is a
<ACRONYM TITLE="Global System for Mobiles">GSM</ACRONYM>
mobile phone combined with a personal organiser running Windows Mobile.
It has a fold-out screen, a full alphanumeric keyboard and an
<ACRONYM TITLE="Secure Digital">SD</ACRONYM>
memory card slot.
It can synchronise with a host PC via a
<ACRONYM TITLE="Universal Serial Bus">USB</ACRONYM>
interface, which also supplies power to charge the lithium-ion battery.

<H2>The Fault</H2>
<P>
My friend's phone was suffering from a connector failure at the USB port,
which meant she couldn't charge the phone.
This meant that she couldn't use the phone as a display for her Bluetooth
<ACRONYM TITLE="Global Positioning System">GPS</ACRONYM>
receiver, either.
</P>
<H2>The Fix</H2>
<P>
We obtained a replacement surface-mount USB connector from
<A HREF="http://rswww.com">RS Components</A>.
I then opened up the back of the phone by removing four small
Torx screws from underneath the battery.
One screw was covered by a red anti-tamper sticker, which I discarded.
The two halves of the phone's case are then clipped together and must be
carefully prised apart.
Having done that, I desoldered the broken USB connector and cleaned up the
<ACRONYM TITLE="Printed Circuit Board">PCB</ACRONYM>
pads with solder braid.
I then carefully soldered in a new connector.
It's tiny, but the surface-mount soldering can be done with a fine tip on
the soldering iron, a steady hand, and good lighting and magnification.
In fact, a stereo microscope would have helped.

Reassembly is the reverse of disassembly.
Clip the two halves of the phone case back together and replace the
four Torx screws.
