I was born in
<A HREF="http://www.colchester.gov.uk/index.html">
Colchester</A>
(yes, that means I'm an Essex man)
and went to the
<A HREF="http://www.colchesterhigh.essex.sch.uk">
Boy's High School</A>
there.
I then went on to the
<A HREF="http://www.crgs.co.uk">
Colchester Royal Grammar School</A>, where I spent many happy
hours with the glowing valves in the school radio station,
<A HREF="rlb.htm">Radio Lexden</A>.
At the
<A HREF="http://www.colch-inst.ac.uk/">
Colchester Institute</A>,
I passed an A-level in Computer Science with a BASIC program
for a Commodore PET.
This helped me
to go on to Westfield College, University of London (now merged with
<A HREF="http://www.qmul.ac.uk">Queen Mary College</A>),
where BASIC was frowned upon and the Coffee Bar
became the best place to get advice
on your Algol-68 programs.
Westfield's refectory and science block, Queen's Building, have now
been demolished and replaced by
<A HREF="http://www.westfieldnw3.co.uk">flats</A>.

My first job was with the London Software Studio,
which subsequently became part of
<A HREF="http://www.dataease.co.uk/">
Sapphire International</A>.
I spent a lot of time there working on a presentation graphics package
called the Enhanced Personal Presentation System (EPPS -
anybody remember using it?).
It was mostly written in compiled BASIC,
but I managed to sneak in quite a bit of 8086 assembler code, too.
I moved on to
<A HREF="http://www.tmi.co.uk/">Time Manager International</A>
where I actually learned something about business, as well
as getting an introduction to making programs useable.
The outcome was a program called TMI Key Results,
written in Turbo Pascal.
At INMOS (now part of <A HREF="http://www.st.com/">SGS-Thomson</A>),
I worked on the transputer and Unix.
I then continued to work with transputers and Unix at
<A HREF="http://www.submetrix.co.uk/">Submetrix</A>,
where the goal was to build a
<A HREF="sonar.htm">sonar</A>
without letting salt water into the high-voltage parts.

I am now working on my PhD at the
<A HREF="http://www.uwe.ac.uk/">University of the West of England</A>.
My research is in the field of metadata for image databases
(in particular problems of user interface and usability) at the
<A HREF="http://www.csm.uwe.ac.uk/faculty/cpim/">Centre for
Personal Information Management</A>.

I used to drive a
<!-- A HREF="http://www.suzuki.be/ffhist31.htm" -->
<!-- A HREF="http://www.dcs.napier.ac.uk/~felix/suzuki/suzsc100.html" -->
<A HREF="http://www.suzuki-sc100.demon.co.uk">Suzuki SC100</A>,
which everybody referred to as the motorised roller-skate.
I liked that little car, but sadly it's now "resting".
Or should that be rusting...
My next motor was a
<!-- HREF="http://www.iceland.demon.co.uk/" -->
<A HREF="http://www.lanciay10.co.uk/">Lancia Y10</A>,
a Fila special edition with the funky bright-blue interior.
After driving two unusual cars, I now have a mundane but
practical <A HREF="http://www.vwpolo.co.uk">VW Polo</A>.
But I'd rather have a bubble-car (see below)!

I wrote my first BASIC program in 1978 on a
<A HREF="http://www.northnet.org/rayzor/cbm/pet2k.html">Commodore PET 2001</A>. 
Soon after this, I built a
<A HREF="uk101.htm">UK101</A> from a kit and learned
<A HREF="http://www3.sk.sympatico.ca/jbayko/cpu.html#6502">6502</A>
assembler programming.
I can still remember the 6502 opcodes, in hex, and I've been
told that there's no cure.
I have since written code on all sorts of machines, notably the
<A HREF="http://www.malch.com/prime/">Prime P750</A>
and
<A HREF="http://www.telnet.hu/hamster/pdp-11/1144.html">PDP-11/44</A>
at Westfield,
the
<A HREF="http://www-1.ibm.com/ibm/history/catalog/itemdetail_57.html">IBM PC</A>,
the
<A HREF="http://www.best.com/~hmk/st4.htm">Atari ST</A>,
the
<A HREF="http://www3.sk.sympatico.ca/jbayko/cpu.html#Transputer">INMOS transputer</A>
and
<A HREF="http://www.sun.com">Sun</A> workstations.
Most of it worked, too.

that I get enthusiastic about:
