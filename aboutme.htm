I was born in
<A HREF="http://www.colchester.gov.uk">
Colchester</A>
(yes, that means I'm an Essex man)
and went to the
<A HREF="http://www.colchesterhigh.essex.sch.uk">
Boy's High School</A>
there.
I then went on to the
<A HREF="http://www.crgs.co.uk">
Colchester Royal Grammar School</A>, where I spent many happy
hours with the glowing valves in the school radio station,
<A HREF="rlb.htm">Radio Lexden</A>.
At the
<A HREF="http://www.colch-inst.ac.uk/">
Colchester Institute</A>,
I passed an A-level in Computer Science with a BASIC program
for a Commodore PET.
This helped me
to go on to Westfield College, University of London (long since merged with
<A HREF="http://www.qmul.ac.uk">Queen Mary College</A>),
where BASIC was frowned upon and the Coffee Bar
became the best place to get advice on your Algol-68 programs.
Westfield's refectory and science block, Queen's Building, have now
been demolished and replaced by flats.

My first job was with the
<A HREF="lsslogo.gif">London Software Studio</A>,
which subsequently became part of
Sapphire International.
I spent a lot of time there working on a presentation graphics package
called the Enhanced Personal Presentation System
(<A HREF="eppslogo.jpg">EPPS</A> &mdash;
anybody remember using it?).
It was mostly written in compiled BASIC,
but I managed to sneak in quite a bit of
<A HREF="http://www.sasktelwebsite.net/jbayko/cpu3.html#Sec3Part7">8086</A>
assembler code, too.
I moved on to
<A HREF="http://www.tmi.co.uk/">Time Manager International</A>
where I actually learned something about business, as well
as getting an introduction to making programs useable.
The outcome was a program called
<A HREF="tmikrsw.jpg">TMI Key Results</A>,
written in Turbo Pascal.
At INMOS (now part of <A HREF="http://www.st.com/">SGS-Thomson</A>),
I worked on the transputer and Unix.
Part of that work resulted in a hardware and
<A HREF="s720sw.jpg">software</A>
package that could run the 
<A HREF="http://www.x.org">X Windows</A>
server on a transputer-based
graphics board (the B020) in an IBM-compatible PC.
I then continued to work with transputers and Unix at
<A HREF="http://www.submetrix.co.uk/">Submetrix</A>,
where the goal was to build a
<A HREF="sonar.htm">sonar</A>
without letting salt water into the high-voltage parts.

<IMG SRC="key32a.gif" ALT="[]" HEIGHT=32 WIDTH=32 ALIGN=LEFT>
I did some work towards a PhD at the
<A HREF="http://www.uwe.ac.uk/">University of the West of England</A>.
My research was in the field of metadata for image databases
(in particular problems of user interface and usability) at the
now-defunct Centre for Personal Information Management.
I also did some teaching on the Human-Computer Interaction
course (UQI120S2), mostly in the practical sessions.

<IMG SRC="key32a.gif" ALT="[]" HEIGHT=32 WIDTH=32 ALIGN=LEFT>
Back in the commercial world, I joined
<A HREF="http://www.eurologic.com">Eurologic</A>'s software
division (now a separate company called
<A HREF="http://www.elipsan.com/">Elipsan</A>), building a
<A HREF="http://www.linux.org/">Linux</A>-based network appliance for
Storage Area Networks (SANs).
Moving on from there, I worked for
<A HREF="http://www.hp.com">Hewlett-Packard</A>, at the
<A HREF="http://www.hpl.hp.com/bristol/index.html">HP Labs</A>
in Stoke Gifford.
The job (a one-year contract) involved looking after some
HP Jornada handheld computers that belong to a wearable and
mobile computing research project,
<A HREF="http://www.mobilebristol.com">Mobile&nbsp;Bristol</A>.
I also developed new hardware and software for the wearables,
and went on to work for the
<A HREF="http://www.bristol.ac.uk/">University of Bristol</A>
to carry on with the project.
After that research ended, I went to Hambrook to work for
<A HREF="http://www.adelix.com/">Adelix</A>, once again
using Linux.
I worked for a while at
<A HREF="http://www.tek.com/">Tektronix</A> in Bristol,
where I wrote C++ software for digital TV quality-control.

<IMG SRC="key32a.gif" ALT="[]" HEIGHT=32 WIDTH=32 ALIGN=LEFT>
I'm now back at
<A HREF="http://www.uwe.ac.uk">UWE</A>, studying for a
Masters degree in Robotics.

I used to drive a
<!-- A HREF="http://www.suzuki.be/ffhist31.htm" -->
<!-- A HREF="http://www.dcs.napier.ac.uk/~felix/suzuki/suzsc100.html" -->
<A HREF="http://www.suzuki-sc100.demon.co.uk">Suzuki SC100</A>,
which everybody referred to as the motorised roller-skate.
I liked that <A HREF="sc100.htm">little car</A>, but sadly it's now "resting".
Or should that be rusting...
My next motor was a
<A HREF="http://www.nyssa.ltd.uk/Y10/">Lancia Y10</A>,
a Fila special edition with the funky bright-blue interior.
After driving two unusual cars, I had a go with something mundane but
practical, a <A HREF="http://www.vwpolo.co.uk">VW Polo</A>.
However, the urge to get back to a
<A HREF="http://metropolis.japantoday.com/tokyo/413/cars_bikes.asp">K-class</A>
was just too strong, and I now have another Suzuki,
this time the two-seater, convertible, turbocharged, fuel-injected
<A HREF="http://www.score.org.uk/">Cappuccino</A>.
The Cappucino is a great little car, but it's not really a bubble-car;
nor is it electric.
For that, I have a
<A HREF="http://www.cityel.de/">CityCom City-El</A>,
which is pictured
<A HREF="http://www.austinev.org/evalbum/1128">here</A>.

I wrote my first BASIC program in 1978 on a
<A HREF="http://oldcomputers.net/pet2001.html">Commodore PET 2001</A>. 
Soon after this, I built a
<A HREF="uk101.htm">UK101</A> from a kit and learned
<A HREF="http://www.6502.org">6502</A>
assembler programming.
I can still remember the 6502 opcodes, in hex, and I've been
told that there's no cure.
I have since written code on all sorts of machines, notably the
<A HREF="http://www.malch.com/prime/">Prime P750</A>
and
PDP-11/44
at Westfield,
the
IBM PC,
the
<A HREF="http://www.atari.st/">Atari ST</A>,
the
<A HREF="http://www.sasktelwebsite.net/jbayko/cpu7.html#Sec7Part5">INMOS transputer</A>
and
<A HREF="http://www.sun.com">Sun</A> workstations.
Most of it worked, too.

<IMG SRC="key32a.gif" ALT="[]" HEIGHT=32 WIDTH=32 ALIGN=LEFT>
I've never quite made up my mind whether I should work on hardware
or software, and most of my computing work has involved a bit
of both.
I put together an
Acorn System One
in 1979 (for my school electronics lab) and of course the
<A HREF="uk101.htm">UK101</A>
in 1980.
At Westfield, I built a
<A HREF="http://www3.sk.sympatico.ca/jbayko/cpu1.html#Sec1Part4">Z80</A>
project as part of my degree work, as
well as several add-ons for the
<A HREF="uk101.htm">UK101</A>.
In later years, I've done
<A HREF="http://www3.sk.sympatico.ca/jbayko/cpu7.html#Sec7Part5">transputer</A>
designs for
<A HREF="http://www.submetrix.co.uk">Submetrix</A>
and even dabbled in analog electronics.
For a while, I built wearable computers around the
<A HREF="http://www.sasktelwebsite.net/jbayko/cpu1.html#Sec1Part9">PICmicro</A>
chips.
But nowadays, my microcontroller of choice is the
<A HREF="http://www.atmel.com/">Atmel</A>
<A HREF="http://www.atmel.com/products/avr/">AVR</A> chip.
