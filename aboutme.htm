<P>
<IMG SRC="key32a.gif" ALT="[]" HEIGHT=32 WIDTH=32 ALIGN=LEFT>
I was born in
<A HREF="http://www.colchester.gov.uk">
Colchester</A>
(yes, that means I'm an Essex man)
and went to the
<A HREF="https://www.colchesterhighschool.co.uk/">
Boy's High School</A>
there.
I then went on to the
<A HREF="https://www.crgs.co.uk">
Colchester Royal Grammar School</A>, where I spent many happy
hours with the glowing valves in the school radio station,
<A HREF="rlb.htm">Radio Lexden</A>.
At the
<A HREF="https://www.colchester.ac.uk/">
Colchester Institute</A>,
I passed an A-level in Computer Science with a BASIC program
for a Commodore PET.
This helped me to go on to
<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westfield_College">Westfield College</A>,
University of London (long since merged with
<A HREF="https://www.qmul.ac.uk">Queen Mary College</A>),
where BASIC was frowned upon and the Coffee Bar
became the best place to get advice on your Algol-68 programs.
Westfield's refectory, halls of residence and science block, Queen's Building, have now
been demolished and replaced by flats.

My first job was with the
<A HREF="lsslogo.gif">London Software Studio</A>,
which subsequently became part of
Sapphire International.
I spent a lot of time there working on a presentation graphics package
called the Enhanced Personal Presentation System
(<A HREF="eppslogo.jpg">EPPS</A> &mdash;
anybody remember using it?).
It was mostly written in compiled BASIC,
but I managed to sneak in quite a bit of
<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_8086">8086</A>
assembler code, too.
I moved on to
<A HREF="https://www.tmi.co.uk/">Time Manager International</A>
where I actually learned something about business, as well
as getting an introduction to making programs useable.
The outcome was a program called
<A HREF="tmikrsw.jpg">TMI Key Results</A>,
written in
<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Pascal">Turbo Pascal</A>.
At
<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inmos">INMOS</A>
(now part of <A HREF="https://www.st.com/">STMicroelectronics</A>),
I worked on the transputer and Unix.
Part of that work resulted in a hardware and
<A HREF="s720sw.jpg">software</A>
package that could run the 
<A HREF="https://www.x.org">X Windows</A>
server on a transputer-based
graphics board
(the <A HREF="https://www.geekdot.com/the-inmos-b020/">B020</A>) in an IBM-compatible PC.
I then continued to work with transputers and Unix at
<A HREF="https://www.iter-systems.com/history/">Submetrix</A>,
where the goal was to build a
<A HREF="sonar.htm">sonar</A>
without letting salt water into the high-voltage parts.

I did some work towards a PhD at the
<A HREF="https://www.uwe.ac.uk/">University of the West of England</A>.
My research was in the field of metadata for image databases
(in particular problems of user interface and usability) at the
now-defunct Centre for Personal Information Management.
I also did some teaching on the Human-Computer Interaction
course (UQI120S2), mostly in the practical sessions.

Back in the commercial world, I joined
Eurologic's software
division (later a separate company called Elipsan), building a
<A HREF="https://www.linux.org/">Linux</A>-based network appliance for
Storage Area Networks (SANs).
Moving on from there, I worked for
<A HREF="https://www.hp.com">Hewlett-Packard</A>, at the
<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP_Labs#Lab_locations">HP Labs</A>
in Stoke Gifford.
The job (a one-year contract) involved looking after some
HP Jornada handheld computers that belong to a wearable and
mobile computing research project,
<A HREF="https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/mobile-bristol-a-new-sense-of-place">Mobile&nbsp;Bristol</A>.
I also developed new hardware and software for the wearables,
and went on to work for the
<A HREF="https://www.bristol.ac.uk/">University of Bristol</A>
to carry on with the project.
After that research ended, I went to Hambrook to work for
Adelix, once again using Linux.
I worked for a while at
<A HREF="https://www.tek.com/">Tektronix</A> in Bristol,
where I wrote C++ software for digital TV quality-control.
</P>
<P>
<IMG SRC="key32a.gif" ALT="[]" HEIGHT=32 WIDTH=32 ALIGN=LEFT>
I went back to
<A HREF="https://www.uwe.ac.uk">UWE</A>, studying for a
postgraduate degree in Robotics.

<IMG SRC="key32a.gif" ALT="[]" HEIGHT=32 WIDTH=32 ALIGN=LEFT>
Back at work with
<A HREF="https://www.lobsterpictures.tv/">Lobster Pictures</A>,
I designed a time-lapse camera controller around an
<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVR_microcontrollers">Atmel AVR</A> microcontroller.
Moving on to Simulation Systems Ltd.
(now part of <A HREF="https://www.highwaysmagazine.co.uk/Costain-buys-traffic-technology-firm-SSL/2887">Costain</A>),
I did some firmware work on a traffic light controller based on the
Microchip PIC32.
That must have done me some good, because my next job was also based on the PIC32,
this time in a video-game robot called <A HREF="https://www.mekamon.com/">Mekamon</A> for Reach Robotics.
But the good luck didn't last and I'm now back to a 16-bit dsPIC33 in a gadget that
<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_steerable_system">steers the drilling bit</A> of an oil rig.
</P>

<IMG SRC="key32a.gif" ALT="[]" HEIGHT=32 WIDTH=32 ALIGN=LEFT>
I used to drive a
<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzuki_Cervo#SC100" TITLE="Wikipedia: Suzuki Cervo">Suzuki SC100</A>,
which everybody referred to as the motorised roller-skate.
I liked that <A HREF="sc100.htm">little car</A>, but sadly it's now "resting".
Or should that be rusting...
My next motor was a
<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autobianchi_Y10" TITLE="Wikipedia: Autobianchi Y10">Lancia Y10</A>,
a Fila special edition with the funky bright-blue interior.
After driving two unusual cars, I had a go with something mundane but
practical, a <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_Polo_Mk2" TITLE="Wikipedia: Volkswagen Polo Mk2">VW Polo</A>.
However, the urge to get back to a
<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kei_car" TITLE="Wikipedia: Kei car">K-class</A>
was just too strong, and I acquired another Suzuki,
this time the two-seater, convertible, turbocharged, fuel-injected
<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzuki_Cappuccino" TITLE="Wikipedia: Suzuki Cappuccino">Cappuccino</A>.
The Cappucino was a great little car, but it's not really a bubble-car;
nor is it electric.
For that, I had a
<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CityEl" TITLE="Wikipedia: CityEl">CityCom City-El</A>,
which is pictured
<A HREF="https://www.flickr.com/photos/anachrocomputer/albums/72157594555949572/">here</A>.
What could I go for after a Cappuccino?
A white
<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nissan_Cube#Z11" TITLE="Wikipedia: Nissan Cube">Nissan Cube</A>
was less than successful, and too big for my liking.
K-class wins again with my next car, a yellow
<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daihatsu_Copen#L880" TITLE="Wikipedia: Daihatsu Copen">Daihatsu Copen</A>.
And that brings us to another EV, the
<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitsubishi_i-MiEV">Peugeot iOn</A>.

<IMG SRC="key32a.gif" ALT="[]" HEIGHT=32 WIDTH=32 ALIGN=LEFT>
I wrote my first BASIC program in 1978 on a
<A HREF="https://oldcomputers.net/pet2001.html">Commodore PET 2001</A>. 
Soon after this, I built a
<A HREF="uk101.htm">UK101</A> from a kit and learned
<A HREF="http://www.6502.org">6502</A>
assembler programming.
I can still remember the 6502 opcodes, in hex, and I've been
told that there's no cure.
I have since written code on all sorts of machines, notably the
<A HREF="https://www.malch.com/prime/">Prime P750</A>
and
PDP-11/44
at Westfield,
the
IBM PC,
the
<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_ST">Atari ST</A>,
the INMOS
<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transputer">transputer</A>
and
<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Microsystems">Sun</A> workstations.
Most of it worked, too.
</P>
<P>
<IMG SRC="key32a.gif" ALT="[]" HEIGHT=32 WIDTH=32 ALIGN=LEFT>
I've never quite made up my mind whether I should work on hardware
or software, and most of my computing work has involved a bit
of both.
I put together an
<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acorn_System_1">Acorn System One</A>
in 1979 (for my school electronics lab) and of course the
<A HREF="uk101.htm">UK101</A>
in 1980.
At Westfield, I built a
<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zilog_Z80">Z80</A>
project as part of my degree work, as
well as several add-ons for the
<A HREF="uk101.htm">UK101</A>.
In later years, I've done
<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transputer">transputer</A>
designs for Submetrix
and even dabbled in analog electronics.
For a while, I built wearable computers around the
<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PIC_microcontrollers">PIC microcontroller</A>
chips.
But nowadays, my 8-bit microcontroller of choice is the
<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVR_microcontrollers">Atmel AVR</A> chip.
