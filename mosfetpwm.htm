<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>MOSFET PWM DC Motor Controller</H1>
</FONT>
<P>
In connection with my interest in electric vehicles, I've been looking at the
technology of DC motor control.
The usual way (nowadays) to do this is by
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation">PWM</A>
(Pulse-Width Modulation).
However, in earlier designs, such as found in
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tram_controls">trams</A>
and trolleybuses, simple resistor controllers were used.
They have some disadvantages for battery vehicles, but are easy to build and
understand.
<H2>The Resistor Controller</H2>
Just to show how it was done, and to demonstrate some of the disadvantages of
the resistor controller, I built one with three switches and two resistors.
The resistors are 3.3&Omega; and work well with a motor that runs on 12V and
draws about 1Amp with no mechanical load.
I found the high-power resistors in some scrap electronic devices (ink-jet printers,
if I remember correctly).
Note that the switches must all be capable of carrying the full motor current.

The result is a controller that works, but only has three steps instead of
continuously-variable control.
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tram_controls">Tram</A> and trolleybus
controllers were built with many more steps, but still
suffered from the problem of heat dissipation in the resistors.
In a battery vehicle, this heat must come from the energy stored in the
battery, and is therefore a symptom of wasted energy.
Another snag with this design is that the resistors need to be located
somewhere where the heat can be dissipated, but the switches need to
be located at the driving position.
This can lead to very complicated wiring and remote-control problems.

<H2>The MOSFET PWM Controller</H2>
<P>
A much better solution is to rapidly switch the power supply to the motor
on and off.
If the "on" periods are equal to the "off" periods, one could think of
the average motor current being half (50%) of the full "on" current.
If the "on" periods are much smaller than the "off" periods, then we get a
lower average current.
Longer "on" periods and shorter "off" periods will give us higher average
current, up to the normal level when the motor is directly connected to
the battery.
By varying the ratio of "on" time to "off" time, we can get continuously
variable control.
</P>
<P>
So, we need a switch that can be switched on and off many thousands of
times per second, a speed which rules out the practical use of a
mechanical switch.
Fully electronic switches can, of course, be made.
An ordinary bipolar transistor may be used as a switch, for instance.
But at high current levels, a more efficient switch can be made using
a
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_MOSFET">MOSFET</A>
(Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor).
This transistor can be switched on and off very rapidly (millions of
times per second), has a very low resistance when "on" and can handle
the large currents required for big motors.

To generate the variable mark/space ratio square wave, I used a Texas Instruments
<A HREF="http://focus.ti.com/docs/prod/folders/print/tlc3704.html">TLC3704</A>
comparator chip (actually four comparators in one 14-pin package).
The data sheet for this chip includes a circuit diagram (schematic) for a PWM motor controller.
I used this circuit almost directly, but had to correct a mistake where the two inputs to one comparator
were swapped, which meant that the original circuit didn't oscillate.
Another factor in my choice was that I had a bag full of these chips that I'd got from
<A HREF="http://www.freecycle.org/">FreeCycle</A> a little while ago.
For the output switching MOSFET, I used the Fairchild
<A HREF="http://www.fairchildsemi.com/pf/HU/HUF75337P3.html">HUF75337</A>.
This MOSFET is rated at 75A, 55V and 0.014&Omega; on-resistance; it's also available
from <A HREF="http://www.maplin.co.uk">Maplin's</A>.
There's also an
<A HREF="http://www.vishay.com/product?docid=88679&query=MBR4045">MBR4045</A> diode
for back-EMF protection; this was salvaged from a dead
PC power supply, along with a handy heatsink.
I added a 5k&Omega; linear pot in a box to act as a throttle control.
When powered from a 12V lead-acid battery, the circuit can control a 400W Bosch GPA
motor, without the heatsink getting hot.

The two controllers were used to demonstrate motor control for a talk at the
<A HREF="http://www.bevob.org.uk/wordpress/">Battery Electric Vehicles of Bristol</A>
group meeting.
