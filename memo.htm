No modern, busy executive would be without a memo recorder to save
those inspired thoughts for posterity.
Even the modern Psion organisers have a digital voice recording facility,
with a user interface that mimics a tape machine.
The idea of having a small, hand-held tape recorder goes back
a long way, however...

The Grudig EN3 is an early attempt to put all the functions required of
a voice memo recorder in one box.
It's a truly hand-held machine, only slightly larger than a modern
mobile phone.
</P>
The microphone is plugged directly into the top of the machine
and includes an integral recording level meter.
The tape is controlled by a single red lever, just visible in the photo
on the left of the machine.
The three AA batteries are hidden under the tape cassette.

Not to be outdone by the Germans, the Japanese had a go at building
a small tape recorder for the office.
Unlike the Grundig, the Sanyo's microphone is separate from the
body of the machine.
There's a snazzy plastic shoulder strap for carrying the machine and
a leather case to protect it.
Access to the tape magazine is through the bottom of the machine.
One feature of the Sanyo not present on the Grundig is a
speed control.
