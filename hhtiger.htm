An extremely rare British machine from 1984.
Features both a Z80 and a 6809 CPU.
My example has a separate unit with Microvitec colour monitor
and disk drives installed.
On the back of the main unit is the maker's name and address:
HH, Bar Hill, Cambridge, England.
HH were better known for their guitar amplifiers, and ceased trading in 1990.

Some sources claim that the Tiger was only ever a prototype computer, and was
never sold as a production machine.
