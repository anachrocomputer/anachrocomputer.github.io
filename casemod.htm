<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Computers I Have Painted Black</H1>
I have always thought that black was a good colour for a computer.
In fact, I've been painting 'em black since 1980, long before
&ldquo;case-modding&rdquo; became popular.
<H2>1980: Compukit UK101</H2>
<P>
<IMG SRC="cm101.jpg" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=137 ALT="Black UK101" ALIGN=RIGHT>
The  <A HREF="uk101.htm">Compukit UK101</A> was a
<A HREF="http://www.6502.org">6502</A>-based machine, built from a kit.
Supplied without a case, as usual for hobbyist machines of that era.
My father and I built a wooden case with an aluminium panel,
painted black with a black leathercloth lid.
In the photo, it's connected to a monochrome video monitor which
is also in a wooden case, painted black, with a plastic flowerpot
on the back, over the CRT neck.
The UK101 is still working nearly 25 years later,
although I went through a phase of favouring bright,
primary colours and the machine has been repainted in yellow.

<H2>1987: Atari ST</H2>
<P>

Terrific 68000 machine, but who wants to put it in a grey case?
Well, Atari did but I changed that.
I also added two IMS C012 transputer link adaptor chips, as
well as a direct 68000 bus interface connector.

<H2>1992: 386SX-25 PC</H2>
<P>
<IMG SRC="cm386.jpg" WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=254 ALT="Black 386 PC" ALIGN=RIGHT>
Oh how dull, a 386 PC clone.
I put a motherboard in a box; but I painted the box black and added
some aluminium panels.
One panel holds the key-operated power switch, while the other
holds the reset switch.
There's a switch-guard to prevent accidental resets.
All the panels are bolted in with purple anodised aluminium hex-head
bolts (from a bicycle shop).
The original 386SX system ran MS-DOS 5.00, but I gradually upgraded
it into a more powerful machine.
The black case then became home to a screaming Pentium Pro 200MHz
machine, my primary
<A HREF="http://www.slackware.com/">Slackware Linux</A> box.
But it's now retired, mainly because it's an AT-style case and
power supply.
The Pentium Pro motherboard is still in there, as is the 3.5"
floppy disk in a 5.25" tray, but I've robbed out the 72-pin
SIMMs to put into my SGI Indy.

<H2>1998: 486 PC Tower Case</H2>
<P>
Just in case I ever need to run old MS-DOS software, I still have my
old DOS system.
I have quite a bit of C code that I wrote years back for MS-DOS,
much of which is distinctly non-portable.
I was given a tower case that works well with a 486 motherboard at
100MHz, but a beige box would never do.
So it was out with the black spray-paint!
The result is a fine DOS box with silver detailing and modified
control panel.
The power switch is a massive one from an old NCR Unix box, while the
original power-on and Turbo lights are now wired to the activity
LEDs on the network card.
Not that I ever use it, you understand...

<H2>2002: Athlon XP Tower Case</H2>
<P>
My current
<A HREF="http://www.slackware.com/">Slackware Linux</A> box.
Rather a fine ATX format tower case that contains an AMD Athlon
motherboard and a SCSI disk system.

<H2>The Ones That Got Away</H2>
<P>
Way back when I worked for the London Software Studio, I visited
a customer site in the City of London.
They had an original 4.77MHz 8088-based IBM PC Model 5150 with
monochrome screen, entirely painted black.
It looked really stylish.
I wonder what happened to it?
