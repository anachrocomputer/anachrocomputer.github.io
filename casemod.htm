<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Computers I Have Painted Black</H1>
I have always thought that black was a good colour for a computer.
In fact, I've been painting 'em black since 1980, long before
&ldquo;case-modding&rdquo; became popular.
<H2>1980: Compukit UK101</H2>
<P>
A 6502-based machine, built from a kit.
Supplied without a case, as usual for hobbyist machines of that era.
My father and I built a wooden case with an aluminium panel,
painted black with a black leathercloth lid.
Still working nearly 25 years later, although I went through a
phase of favouring bright, primary colours and the UK101 is
now yellow.

<H2>1987: Atari ST</H2>
<P>

Terrific 68000 machine, but who wants to put it in a grey case?
Well, Atari did but I changed that.
I also added two IMS C012 transputer link adaptor chips, as
well as a direct 68000 bus interface connector.

<H2>1992: 386SX-25 PC</H2>
<P>
Oh how dull, a 386 PC clone.
I put a motherboard in a box; but I painted the box black and added
some aluminium panels.
One panel holds the key-operated power switch, while the other
holds the reset switch.
There's a switch-guard to prevent accidental resets.
All the panels are bolted in with purple anodised aluminium hex-head
bolts (from a bicycle shop).
The original 386SX system ran MS-DOS 5.00, but I gradually upgraded
it into a bigger box.
The black case then became home to a screaming Pentium Pro 200MHz
machine, my primary
<A HREF="http://www.slackware.com/">Slackware Linux</A> box.
But it's now retired, mainly because it's an AT-style case and
power supply.

<H2>The Ones That Got Away</H2>
<P>
Way back when I worked for the London Software Studio, I visited
a customer site in the City of London.
They had an original 4.77MHz 8088-based IBM PC Model 5150 with
monochrome screen, entirely painted black.
It looked really stylish.
I wonder what happened to it?
