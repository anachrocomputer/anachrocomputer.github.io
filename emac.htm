<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Repairing The DVD Drive in an Apple eMac</H1>
<H2>About the Machine</H2>
<P>
<!-- SRC="pdp1134.jpg" WIDTH=250 HEIGHT=262 ALT="PDP-11/34" ALIGN=RIGHT -->
The Apple eMac is one of the "New World" Macs that were released following the
success of the iMac.
This particular machine was a 700MHz, Revision 1 eMac.
It had the higher spec DVD/CDR drive fitted, which should have been
capable of reading DVDs and burning CDs.
</P>
<H2>The Fault</H2>
<P>
My friend's eMac had a defective DVD/CDR drive.
The only option was to remove and replace it, but first we had to
get the eMac open and dig down to the drive.
</P>
<H2>The Fix</H2>
<P>
We obtained a replacement drive from somewhere; I think it was from
<A HREF="http://www.freecycle.org">FreeCycle</A>.
We actually fitted a plain DVD drive, because that's what we had.

<P>
Reassembly is the reverse of disassembly.
