Nicole, the original owner of the SC100, in 1988.
This was shortly after I'd bought the car from her, and we were
doing some work on cleaning and tidying up.
I'd previously done quite a bit of work on it,
right from new in 1980,
when I fitted a Selmar pendulum-type car alarm.
Since then, we'd done routine maintenance like changing the
spark plugs (via the inspection panel in the rear of the back seat).
The front grille badge had fallen off by this time!

This photo shows me, in the car.
The SC100, also known as the Whizzkid, was introduced to the UK in 1979
as Suzuki's first car.
It was closely followed by the hugely successful Suzuki jeeps, some
of which are powered by the same engine as the SC100.
It's a two-door, four-seater rear-engined, rear wheel drive coup&eacute;.
The engine is a water-cooled four-cylinder four-stroke with 997cc capacity.
Technically, it's quite basic with a standard carburettor, conventional
ignition, no turbo and no brake servo.
It does, however, have front wheel disc brakes.

All fixed up after an accident in 1989 that dented the passenger
door, this is the car in 1990 outside my newly-purchased house
in Bristol.

</DIV>
This photograph shows my SC100 as it was in 1991, outside my mum's
house in Colchester.
Note the lack of a front grille badge and the passenger side mirror.
Also note the second disc, above the tax disc, which was my INMOS
car park pass.
I really like this view of the car, which shows the effect of the
bonnet lines, giving the car a "face".

This photo shows a side view, along with my friend, Fran.
Note the orange and red stripe along the groove just below the
door handles.

Here's another photo, taken in Wales in 1993.

<IMG SRC="sc100_1993b.jpg" WIDTH=450 HEIGHT=344 ALT="Rear of SC100 in 1993">
</DIV>
This is the only photo I have of the rear of the car.
Note the dented bumper, due to a parking incident in
Waitrose car park with a bollard.
The grille that's visible here is, of course, the engine cover.
It hinges down for access to the carburettor and inlet manifold
side of the engine, while access to the spark plugs and exhaust
manifold is via a panel behind the rear seat.
